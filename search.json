    "section": "Meeting Details",
    "text": "Meeting Details\n\nNovember 19, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nKicking off the November 19th Urban Design Commission meeting, two items submitted by IA, LLP. for signage exceptions were moved to the evening’s consent agenda. Both locations sit in District 17–specifically at 2104 City View Drive, which is included on Legistar 90603, and 2130 City View Drive, Legistar 90604. Signage is being requested on an elevation that would not normally allow for posting; however, the proposed units would be smaller than the zoning maximum and a need had been determined by Staff for building identification.\n\nContinued Discussion on New Downtown Apartments for Students\nThe first of two items up for discussion this evening was Legistar 89583. This meeting was a follow-up to their September 17th informational presentation regarding a new mixed-use building in DC Zoning within District 2, located at 425 North Frances Street and 450 West Gilman Street. The Urban Design Commission acted as an advisory body to the Plan Commission on the item.\nThe applicant team reminded UDC the proposal was already in front of the Landmarks Commission, where they found the massing was acceptable in relation to the Grimm Book Bindery historic building and was suggested for approval. Since their last presentation, they have moved the commercial space from Francis to Gilman Street to enhance public access, community engagement, and align with current street design.\n\n\n\nUpdated floor plan showing lobby/parking and new commercial space location.\n\n\nVehicular access will be shared between garbage pick-up and parking space. The ramp is planned to include a parking sign to make it apparent to guests there is a lot available for public use. Based on feedback, the applicant team has opted to go with a more transparent garage door in order to activate the space more and provide more transparency when viewing the building from the outside.\n\n\n\nElevations and garage door.\n\n\nThe building has been divided into a two-tower massing with a third lower, two story section at the front, which not only breaks the building up to give it the feel of multiple buildings instead of one large, ominous unit, but also highlights the “verticality” of the design. The pallet was updated slightly to consist mainly of contemporary style, textured metal panels. Due to the angularity of the North Francis Street grid, previous designs were less consistent—the updated design has been cleaned up to align with the strong street frontage.\n\n\n\nConcept rendering showing Francis Street refresh and building massing.\n\n\nThe applicant team also took the time to highlight how additional landscaping has been included on the roof and the pool has been stepped down in order to not overshadow the Grimm Book Bindery next door without losing some of the amenities the developer aims to provide future residents.\n\n\n\nRooftop rendering\n\n\nCommissioner Bernau jumped into the conversation to ask about building materials and their placement. The applicant team noted brass accents and Casablanca greytoned brick is specifically planned for the first two floors of the North Francis Street side—reserving the accents for the lower jut-out of the building only. There was further questioning from Commissioner Klehr on the horizontal alignments in the rendering and how they play into the color scheme. Concerning the rendering, it was determined the actual design was in proper alignment; however, the rendering did not properly show the color depth in relation to the sections’ alignment. While it was ultimately a non-issue, it is worth noting the UDC’s concern over such matters.\nWith regard to the pool, Commissioner Klehr questioned the materials being used for the pool and if they would stand the test of time. The developers assured the Commission the pool was safe, being composed of an acrylic they have used on several prior projects. The material will not yellow over time and maintain its clarity for years to come. They also discussed the walkway space between the pool and the rooftop edge. This is required by the Health Department for safety reasons, and it was clarified this will not be an infinity pool—though they hope to give it that feel. Commissioner Mblinyi noted she was excited to see the building once it is built; however, further discussion in conjunction with comments by Commissioner Bernau led to the realization the pool will be minimally visible from the street.\nCommissioner McLean questioned the street level lighting next. The design team stated they were aiming for interior fixtures that will provide a vibrant building glow, which will spill out onto the street through numerous windows. This is meant to activate the space even after dark, as the interior glow will raw attention to the space while duality providing enough lighting for pedestrians outside. It was then further clarified the interior light fixtures would not ne facing out onto the street or pointed in any way—instead the developer is using specific angles and lighting styles that will naturally illuminate the streetscape with their light spill.\n\n\n\nCommissioner McLean questioning the lighting plan.\n\n\nCommissioner Bernau asked why work the applicant team had done or was in the process of doing with the Forestry department. The developers stated they had been working with Urban Forestry to determine which trees were worth restoring and which should be replaced. Commissioner Bernau was especially concerned with an Ash tree located along North Francis Street, which previous images showed it may be in poor health. Both the UDC and the applicant team were in agreement there was not use trying to save a tree that would not ultimately benefit the area, but ultimately a decision would be made after further conversation with Forestry has been had. If replacement trees are needed, the team hopes to have a more hardy variety that will be less prone to disease and is more vibrant.\nIn the end, the commission concluded most of their remaining commentary fell to items the City would be responsible for (namely street lamps and streetscaping with the trees). As such, the item was recommended for approval by Plan Commission with the conditions of modifying the garage door to add glazing and to taper the rooftop section of the pool back to the main building facade, so it communicates more effectively with its neighboring historic building.\n\n\nNew Construction at 124 East Gorham Street\nThe second and final item of the evening focused on Legistar 90077, a new residential building complex in the Mansion Hill Historic District in District 2, to be located at 124 East Gorham Street. The Urban Design Commission acted as an advisory body to the Plan Commission on this item, following its August 18th certificate of approval from the Landmarks Commission.\n\n\n\nAreal View provided by Apex Property Management and Kahler Slate, INC.\n\n\nAfter receiving unanimous approval from the Landmark’s commission, the applicant team highlighted their work on the building massing and keeping an appropriate scale with their new building. They stated their goal was to keep proportions and size in rhythm with the surrounding area so it does not look out of place. In that same vein, the planned materials and colors are meant to compliment older buildings and pay home age to the historical landmarks nearby. That being said, their goal is not to replicate older architecture, but update the design enough to make the building have that new, finished appearance without standing out.\n\n\n\nStreet rendering of new complex, showing how it communicated with existing neighborhood.\n\n\nCommissioner McLean was a bit concerned with the size of the porch along Gorham Street—especially the stairs that extend directly to the sidewalk. The applicant team notes there is limited space and, while they have played with moving the building back and forth within the space, they ultimately found this to be the best design. The developers also noted an accessible side ramp, which utilized a sidewalk that cuts between their complex and the building directly to their left. Commissioner McLean admitted he may be asking for miracles, but requested the development team look into their design further in order to better use the space, rather than fill it with stairs and deck space.\nCommissioner Bernau questioned the reasoning behind the roof pitch line. The designers said there were multiple factors, including code requirements and space needed to make their upstairs unit a fully livable space without making the complex appear even more massive by raising the roof. Moving onto landscaping, Commissioner Bernau for clarification on the differences between the renderings and the submitted planted designs. While the application did not include small-scale trees and shrubs, they were included in the renderings for tonight’s presentation. He believed the space did not look as good without them and wanted to know if they would ultimately be included or if they were simply added to the renderings for aesthetics. The design team noted they do in fact want to include the plantings shows, as they believe it adds depth and scaling to the space; however, they were still working out details of which specific plants should be put in and what will work with the space long-term. As such, they are not formally included, but should be with future updates.\n\n\n\nCourtyard rendering with shrubs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted planting proposal.\n\n\nCommissioner Mbilinyi, with clarifying help from Commissioner Klehr, suggested making a L-shaped stair to preserve space and activate the area more. Commissioner Klehr further stated concern with how close the railing would be to the sidewalk. She shared her thoughts on the potential for pedestrians getting caught as they navigate the sidewalk—which would be especially dangerous if it was someone jogging or riding a scooter. Commissioner McLean then requested additional details on how far out the soffits are expected to stick out with the current design. The developer said it is about 18”, in part because of zoning requirements and also due to trying to keep the proportions in line with the overall design.\n\n\n\nRealistic street view rendering of 124 East Gorham Street proposal.\n\n\nAfter minimal discussion between commission members, the item was recommended for approval by the Plan Commission, with conditions to review the stairway and landing, as well as increase the eve overhang at the front of the building and incorporate more plantings into the courtyard design.\n\n\n\nNovember 6, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nMeeting Minutes\nFollowing a series of lengthy meetings, the Urban Design Commission kept it short and sweet for their November 6th assembly. Moving quickly, agenda item three was immediately approved under the evening’s consent agenda—Legistar 90175: a public building for the City of Madison Water Utility at 801 South Whitney Way in District 11.\n\nTradewinds Flex Building\n\n\n\nProposal\n\n\nThe one and only item left for discussion was Legistar 90324: a new building set to be constructed at 4846 Tradewinds Parkway in Urban Design District (UDD) 1 within District 16. This will be a new warehouse project just east of the belt line next to the Sleep Inn & Suites Madison - Monona. Currently, the parking lot is being used to store Amazon vehicles. Aside from that, the applicant team notes it is mostly a greenfield site.\nConstruction is currently planned for Spring 2026; however, the design has been purposely left as an open concept since there are currently no tenants set to lease the space. The building is primarily cement-based, but the development team has opted to add additional pops of color by painting bands across the upper half of the side, as well as having broken up the massing by painting the lower half a darker shade of gray, while the top will be a lighter gray tone.\n\n\n\nRendering showing color choices and building paint pattern\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering showing all building sides and design.\n\n\nCommissioner Bernau asked about building constraints with regard to the neighboring highway and the site’s landscaping potential. The applicant team noted a drainage easement along the south, which limits planting options. To the north, there is driveway interference, which has provided additional obstacles with planting. That being said, they are working to leave existing grass undisturbed as much as possible—only regrading areas where the warehouse will be set. Not only would this allow them to ‘reuse’ the existing landscaping in order to reallocate some of the budget to add additional shrubs and trees, but it also aids in erosion control with what currently exists naturally. According to Commissioner Bernau, the section to the east—which faces the hotel—could use more landscaping. He specifically suggested tall, narrow evergreens. An additional note was then made about the grading near the parking section. Due to how low the ground sets, he believed they could add some taller plantings and fuller trees. Making one final comment on what he assumed was a typo, Commissioner Bernau clarified bark mulch should be used throughout (whereas one section was noted to use rock, rather than wood-based filler).\n\n\n\nLandscaping proposal.\n\n\nDuring a discussion about rooftop mechanicals, Commissioner McLean asked where units would be located. The developers stated they struggled to anticipate where the exact location will be, since it could depend on the tenants’ needs; however, they expect rooftop units to be located somewhat centrally to each warehouse section.\nCommissioner Asad critiqued the entries, stating the overall color design and sectioning was well balanced; however, the doors deemed much more haphazardly thrown in. That being said, he felt the utilitarian style in conjunction with the intended use did not warrant a full discussion. As such, a movement was made and the item was approved with conditions regarding landscaping.\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nMeeting Minutes\nYet another discussion-heavy meeting was held Wednesday evening, when the Urban Design Commission met to discuss several returning items, as well as hear from City Staff about changes and reminders regarding the UDC’s objectives and purview. To start things off, both of the items proposed by the Madison Metropolitan School District were moved to the consent agenda for unanimous approval.\n\nConsent Agenda:\n\nLegistar 88480: public building for MMSD Gompers Elementary and Black Hawk Middle Schools, located at 1402 Wyoming Way in District 18.\nLegistar 88482: public building for MMSD Sherman Middle and Malcolm Shabazz High Schools, located at 1601 North Sherman Avenue in District 12.\n\n\n\n\nMinor alterations proposed to previously approved plans for 929 East Washington Avenue.\n\n\n\n\nAlterations to the Hilton Tempo & Homewood Suites Proposal\nMoving to the first item of the remaining agenda, the Commission reviewed Legistar 90073, which seeks approval for alterations to a previously approved development in Urban Design District 8, located at 929 East Washington Avenue in District 6. Alterations include changing brick and adding some accent masonry, as well as replacing steel with precast concrete. The skin will now be a pre-fabricated facade. The depth and locations of windows have not changed—it is just the materials.\nThe new brick does have a texture and the development team plans to use a stacking method in order to give it a more modern look. The precast steel still has a smooth, almost shiny finish. The decision to move to the “knock-off finish” is in part due to a twenty five year warranty that guarantees no sun fading, paint chipping, or issues with the overall look, all while still being within budget. Another benefit of the precast faux steel is that it does not require maintenance or rust—ensuring the building’s appearance will remain in quality standing for the next few decades.\n\n\n\nMaterial changes.\n\n\nOther minor changes include adjustments to canopies and trim, in order to give the building a more refined, throughout look. Additionally, a small rooftop trellis has been added to offer cover from the weather while occupants utilize the rooftop amenities. Despite the changes, most of the planting pallet has not been altered and the applicant team has chosen to keep a myriad of outdoor amenities. These include a pool, yard game area, and gathering space on the planted roof, as well as a lower patio with grills, tables, and additional open green space.\n\n\n\nRooftop amenities rendering.\n\n\nCommissioner McLean asked about elevations; however, the applicant team instead focused on the parking ramp which sits internal to the block. They spoke to future plans to connect other buildings, which would absorb the parking ramp further, while still making it available for use by visitors to other businesses in the area. Getting back to Commissioner McLean’s question, the applicant team pointed the UDC to the appendix, which offered a rough overview of the site’s elevations, but was not guaranteed to be entirely accurate due to how the parking ramp is situated.\nWith little further comment, the application received final approval from the Commission.\n\n\nSignage Review for Re Mixers Inc. \nUp next was Legistar 89896: major amendment to an approved comprehensive design review for signage (CDR) at 1802-1902 Wright Street in District 12. While the original application was for ground signage, some signs existed prior to the CDR amendment. This is, in part, why the specific amendment is being requested, as the design team seeks to match existing signage.\nAs noted in the staff report, there is concern over harmony between the signs, as well as necessity due to the number of established ground signs; however, if the UDC does believe another sign is warranted, they must clearly state their findings as to why the CDR should be approved. Commissioner McLean got clarification on Staff’s concerns being the materials and placement. Staff confirmed, adding the design and color scheme is also a factor. The UDC must decide if the design is consistent with the existing installments.\n\n\n\nNew signage design and installment rendering.\n\n\nCommissioner Bernau questioned if the new signage should remain the same datum and zone height in order to match the existing signage. The team from Sign Art clarified their design allows for individual mounted letters which, according to the property manager, can vary in color as long as they are individually mountable. Allie Novitske, with the design team, argued they have met the criteria outlined by the UDC and met the City’s zoning codes since they are following the same height bands—maintaining what they view as a consistent design. Staff Vaughn clarified, stating between the difference in building heights, signs’ zoned heights when there are multiple fixtures on a single development, and different sizing, things become inconsistent. To Commissioner Bernau’s point, sign consistency should not just be with the location-specific signs, but the neighboring commercial spaces’ signage as well. Commissioner Bernau referenced the red signs being used at different heights on different species within the building. While the proposed sign fits the zoning by itself, it does not fit with the other business’ fixtures. As such, he believes the design team should be staying within the previously approved section.\n\n\n\nApproved installment areas, highlighted in green.\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr, admitting to possibly being obtuse, asked if her understanding was correct that signs could not be installed on the brick, but can be adhered to the previously approved EIFS (exterior insulation and finishing systems) area. This was confirmed, with Sign Art stating this was another reason the decided to propose a backing board. This response led Commissioner McLean to ask about the backer board itself and whether or not it would be directly applied to the building. Staff Vaughn further asked if her understanding was correct in that the darker section of the design was being considered the backer board for the independently mounted lettering. Novitske confirmed both Commissioner McLean’s and Staff Vaughn’s understanding, again noting this was because of the letters being independent units.\nAlder Mayer critiqued the Re Mixers Inc. logo, wondering why Sign Art was changing the design to match the building by using a dark brown backer board rather than black. Staff Vaughn quickly jumped in to say the logo was not being modified, only the color in order to match the building; however, Novitske contradicted the statement by stating other locations did not use a backing, so they were in fact modifying the logo to match the CDR requirements.\nStaff Vaugh added the CDR amendment at play this evening was modified in 2018, further stating if the ground signs had been mounted properly a CDR would not be needed—which is part of the concerns listed within the staff report. Novitske chimed in to say the option had been explored, but ultimately was decided against as a lit ground sign would cost thousands more than what they are proposing.\nThis continued to confuse Commissioner Klehr, as other company logos appeared to be round and not contain letters (according to Google Earth, at least). While not within the UDC’s purview, it added to the Commission’s confusion as to what the exact request being made was and why Sign Art needed an amendment to an already approved application.\nMoving into deliberation, Commissioner McLean noted liking the lower sign than what is allowed on the main facades should they approve installments on the building corners. He believed higher signage on the corners looked like they would be for the entire building, rather than just the corner units’ tenants. Commissioner McLean further stated he did not understand why a backer was not being used, then covered with a logo—which would not need an amendment. Similarly, Commissioner Klehr and Alder Mayer both questioned the need for the sign, with Commissioner Klehr saying she would imagine the other tenants would not be happy about another sign overshadowing their business’. This was in stark contrast to Commissioner Asad’s thinking, where he believed the sign should be allowed to go over the entry. Upon closer review though, the entries to the corner businesses vary by building within the complex—with some being on the corner and others being off to the side. Due to this, Commissioner Asad rescinded his comment, stating the entry variances further complicated the issue.\nWith Commissioner Bernau stating the obvious that “this one isn’t easy,” the UDC ultimately approved the item with conditions of findings.\n\n\nMulti-Family Residence at 139 West Wilson Street\nDoug Pahl from Aro Eberle Architects was back before the UDC following their June informational presentation to review Legistar 88479: a new multi-family residential building in UMX Zoning, located at 139 West Wilson Street in District 4. One major change was widening the driveway by about twenty feet to allow service vehicles and delivery trucks to park along the side without blocking other vehicles, as well as provide additional space for pedestrians and cyclists navigating the space. Additionally, the flexible parking spaces for ridesharing have been relocated, which should allow the aforementioned vehicles to turn around more easily and safely.\n\n\n\nUpdated driveway design provided by Aro Eberle Architects.\n\n\nAccording to Pahl, there have also been window modifications—which included removing one set towards the bottom in order to contextualize the datum with adjacent buildings and standardize the remaining windows’ spacing within the development, as well as bring down the cornice containing the green space mural. Another modification has been made to the proposal’s elevation, which allowed their team to bring down some of the paneling sections to be more consistent. Overall, Pahl favors the new massing in relation to how it is now “receiving its neighbor” and the buildings align.\n\n\n\nElevation optics, showing materials, window spacing, and cornice changes.\n\n\nJonathan Cooper, from the Bassett Neighborhood Association, shared concerns over the inadequacy of the driveability within the area and no on-site parking. Their association is especially concerned over the additional traffic a three hundred and twenty unit building will generate, referencing food deliveries, Amazon drop-off, and cabs. Despite the driveway changes, larger UPS and Amazon trucks will be too tall to fit within the turnaround space and too long to fully turn—meaning traffic will begin backing up into an already heavily-used street. As such, their association asks the proposal be denied as they believe the area cannot support the additional residents.\nRandall Alexander, with the development team, chimed in to share the average length of UPS and Amazon delivery trucks—stating they have allotted enough space within their paved area to adequately accommodate them. Alder Mayer then tanked the presenters, but asked if they had an estimate of the number of deliveries that might be made to a residential space of this size. Although the development team did not have an estimate, stating it was a “moving target;” however, they would expect the figures to be lower than the average since this is planned to be income-based housing. There was further discussion between Alder Mayer and the developer regarding moving trucks and furniture deliveries. Because these will be smaller units with lower income, the developers do not expect semis to be in the space at any point.\nMoving to the design itself, Commissioner Asad asked about standardizing the top height and using more wood paneling along the backside. The developer chose not to add more wood to the non-street facing side as only the residents will see it and they did not feel it added anything to the overall design. Commissioner Asad disagreed, believing it would in fact add something extra for the residents, rather than being boring and monotonous. Regarding the top of the building, there are planned service compartments and rooftop mechanicals, which do not need an entire floor. In an attempt to cut costs, they decided to only include housing for the service space and mechanical units. The Commission deliberated over the building height, stating they would prefer some changes made to the datum in order to reduce the height to be more human-scale. Alder Mayer further stated he thinks it is a bold move to not include parking for residents. Although he does not own a car and has never owned one, he doubts the developers will find three hundred and twenty (or more) residents like him and is overall intrigued by the venture.\n\n\n\nUpdated street view rendering of the development, which will take the place of the former Paisan’s building.\n\n\nCommissioner Bernau believed the developer had done a good job all around—specifically mentioning the modifications made following the informational meeting and adequately justified their driveway changes. Although he was not sure about the code requirements, he though the project was showing a great deal of promise. There was further discussion surrounding your Capitol views; however, it was determined that falls outside of the Commission’s purview. As an advisory body, the UDC recommended approval by the Plan Commission with conditions, which can be satisfied administratively.\n\n\nMifflin Street Complex Proposal\nThe last application before UDC Wednesday evening was Legistar 90048: residential building complex slated for 511-515 West Dayton Street in District 4. Some may remember this site as the location where rowdy Mifflin Street Block-partiers flipped a car last year and the GoFundMe the followed. The applicant team noted the incident and stated their goal with the driveway is to make odds less likely to have a repeat incident. Additional measures to deter future party goers includes back yard fencing that will allow for twenty feet between each building. Neighboring land owners have been supportive of the proposal and are said to have liked the harmony the fence will bring by being placed almost equidistant between other residences.\n\n\n\nFront view showing driveway.\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed site plan, including fencing outline.\n\n\nThe four new residences will be two stories with four rooms each. The current plan is to use two gray shades of vinyl siding with light stone and wood-patterned accents, plus some white trim. There are also plans for five bike spaces to be provided at the front of each deck, which is not noted in the renderings. Commissioner McLean asked about planar changes between the trim and siding, to which the developer stated it was a “straight material change.” Commissioner McLean asked if there was any way to add more texture and tone to the building, aside from the trim transitioning to the wood accents; however, the applicant team shared concern over the impact that would have to entryways and patio spaces due to the additional volume a material change would provide.\n\n\n\nMaterial and color pallet overview.\n\n\nKicking off UDC’s deliberation, Commissioner Bernau critiqued the “away ward balance of the planting design,” saying there could be something of more stature in place of their current sedge. Commissioner Hellrood agreed, further stating there could be additional structure balance within the corridor space.\nDiscussion was then transitioned by Commissioner McLean to focus on the windows. He tied in the material transitions, asking the applicant team if they could alter the spacing and materials to add depth. This led to the public discussion being reopened for a response by the developer. They responded their team could certainly look into it, noting one of the challenges would be the height of the windows and landlords being able to maintain them. The outdoor stairs lead to an attic space, which causes the windows to fall within an intermediate space. They still believed they could evaluate options that would help break up the massing and hopefully find some middle ground if they could not come up with a full compromise. With that, the Commission moved back into deliberation.\n\n\n\nDigital rendering of complex proposal.\n\n\nLatching on to windows and spacing, Commissioner Barnau sided with Commissioner McLean—stating the windows near the bike racks, or lack thereof, a bit awkward and should be considered by the applicant team.\nAs an advising body on the item, the UDC was not quite ready to give their full seal of approval. While the item was recommended for approval by the Plan Commission, it will return before UDC prior to moving forward in the application process.\n\n\nRe-examining UDC’s Evaluations & Purview\nWhile not an application, the final item of the evening began what will be a much larger discussion surrounding Legistar 88585: and informational presentation and discussion on the Urban Design Code Update Project.\nIn 2022, the City of Madison began evaluating ordinances, policies, and commissions’ purviews. Once of the main questions they addressed was “what are the City’s urban design goals?” This included key concepts such design details, contextual elements, and active streetscapes. Materials, colors, landscaping, and ornamental details were all deemed to be of importance to residents and stand as the most impactful pieces to consider when critiquing proposals. There was also a large focus on how private spaces impact and interact with the public. Things like setbacks, pedestrian pathways, and massing were said to be the most influential details.\n\n\n\nThings to consider when looking at the City’s urban design goals.\n\n\nCommissioner Mbilinyi admitted having to visit the mayor’s office four times to get an understanding of what UDC’s purpose. There was some discussion by staff and the Commissioner regarding codes that fall outside of UDC’s purview, with Mbilinyi asking for clarification on whether or not they should be drawing attention to things like pedestrian and traffic safety concerns when hearing an item. Staff Vaughn clarified that there are other evaluations happening by entities such as City Engineering, City Traffic, and similar bodies who evaluate items that fall outside of the UDC’s purview. As such, there is not a need to spend time during the meetings where the main focus is an issue needing to be addressed by the appropriate body. This specific commission’s job is primarily to evaluate the impact developments will have on the general public and ensure a positive outcome—not to focus on details they do not like or that are someone else’s responsibility to review.\nThere was lengthy discussion between Staff and the Commissioners regarding who is responsible for which aspects of the applications they see. While it was dependent on the type of development, location, and sometimes even the design proposal, Staff overall encouraged the UDC to reframe their thinking to view items as “how can we make this better for the community,” rather than “what is wrong with this proposal.” Commissioner Bernau noted how “density is, like, pitted against Urban Design… I don’t think that needs to be the case.” This led into Commissioners who are listened planner and architects tent to consider issues such as health, safety, and pedestrian access due to their professional training. While this can fall outside their purview, it gives some context as to why their conversations tend to stray into territory that is not theirs.\nUltimately, the Commission agreed they need to “get back to [their] roots,” focusing on pieces that will impact public experience rather than their individual preferences. Commissioner Bernau admitted to spending too much time focusing on landscaping that fits his personal preference instead of viewing plans through a public enrichment lens. Staff Vaughn also went over design reviews for different zoning districts. Notably, heavily industrial areas need less design review than residential due to the nature of the buildings and their locations. While there may still need to be some discussion, the Urban Design Commission was overall advised to spend less time critiquing developments such as storage units, warehouses, and the like.\n\n\n\nAreas needing less design review.\n\n\nDue to a mix of technical difficulties and commissioners needing to leave the meeting for prior engagements, the UDC made a few brief closing remarks—saving this remainder of the discussion for future meetings and adjourning for the night.\n\n\n\nOctober 8, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nThe first Urban Design Commission meeting of October kicked off with Commissioner Bernau disclosing he worked on a previous iteration of Item Seven (Legistar 90072); however, he stated he is no longer involved with the project as it was part of a position he held with a previous employer. With that, the UDC dove into another lengthy meeting—although this week they managed to keep it to three hours rather than five, in part thanks to moving two items to the evening’s consent agenda for approval. It should be noted Commissioner Mblinyi was missing from the discussion and, without role call being taken aloud, it is unclear if she was even in attendance following UDC’s heated September 17th meeting.\n\nConsent Agenda:\n\nLegistar 89410: Comprehensive design review for signage at 1704 Roberts Court in District 13.\nLegistar 90066: Report of the Facade Grant Staff Team for 2038 Jenifer Street, or the Jenifer Street Market, located in District 6.\n\n\n\nEast Wash and Ridgeway Mixed-Use Redevelopment Approved\nMoving on the the evening’s public hearing items, the Commission started with reviewing Legistar 86815. The UDC is an approving body for the application, which is for a new multi-family residential building at 3222, 3230, and 3238 East Washington Avenue and 3229 Ridgeway Avenue in Urban Design District (UDD) 5, located within District 12).\n\n\n\nMixed use redevelopment building proposal\n\n\nThe item was last seen before UDC in January, but was put on hold until Summer 2025. While the site remains the same, the applicant team reminded the Commission about the grading on the Carpenter Street side—which has impacted the overall building design. Essentially, one side of the building appears to be only three stories, while the other seems to be five.\n\n\n\nSite plan\n\n\nOne of the principal changes to the proposal is the developer’s shift from affordable housing to affordable senior housing. Although the unit mix and some of the existing conditions they had applied for will be different, the overall building plan has only received minor changes. These include more breathing room and setbacks for the building, additional pedestrian access from Carpenter Street, and an additional walk up along East Washington Avenue—all of which were made based on comments from their informational presentation in January.\nThere is a fifteen foot shared easement on the side of the building opposite from Carpenter street, which the applicant team did not specifically review, but welcomed questions on. The design team has also chosen to incorporate a shared courtyard into the center of the horseshoe style building layout, not only offering a community space, but a reprieve for neighbors as well so they are presented with some green space rather than a large building. The color palette will be mostly muted natural tones comprised of masonry materials. The building will have a small commercial space, which is meant to offer services not only to the building residents, but the community at large.\n\n\n\nRendering provided by KBA, showing grading and color overview\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr asked the design team why the majority of the project was so consistent, but not the brass tone canopies. She specifically noted how one of the street-facing sections has this nice color pop on the corner, but the rest seem to have been left with the darker gray tones. Without providing an exact answer, the applicant responded they were open to adding more color to the building to make it more consistent. Following her comments on the color of the canopies, Commissioner Klehr also clarified with the design team that HVAC units will be internal. The applicant confirmed this, additionally stating the coverings along the facade will be paint-matched to the surrounding materials to help the units blend in with the remainder of the building.\n\n\n\nConcept image showing canopies and design choices\n\n\nAlong the west elevation, commissioner Bernau specifically asked about the easement and questioned if there was enough space for some height in the plantings. He argued it would help anchor the space, offering advice on taller, more narrow deciduous trees—specifically offering gum trees at one point. The applicant shared insight into conversations with City Water Utility and MG&E, explaining they would like closer to twenty feet in that area due to underground utilities; therefore, the developers went with a more sparse planting plan. Commissioner Bernau stood his ground, asserting additional shrubs and trees would be more respectful to the neighbors.\n\n\n\nLandscaping Plan.\n\n\nMoving into deliberation, Commissioner Bernau thought the site plan was well done and liked the incorporation of planted terracing in the design, with his only remaining critique being a single tree’s planting being moved to another side of the building. Commissioner Asad, chimed in to thank Commissioner Klehr for her questions, stating he believed most of her questions addressed conditions which could be added to the approval of the application. Thanking Commissioner Asad, Commissioner Klehr reviewed conditions such as consistent entrances (including the orange canopies), siding not coming down over the masonry, and amending the planting specified by Commissioner Bernau, with consideration of City Engineering and MG&E’s requirements. Commissioner McLean agreed with the conditions, especially with regard to siding on the front and west side elevations. With that, a motion was passed and the items was approved with conditions.\n\n\nMixed-Use Redevelopment at East Wash and Fair Oaks Approved\nMoving on to Legistar 87242 regarding a new mixed-use building and townhomes at 3357-3375 East Washington Avenue and 922-930 North Fair Oaks Avenue in Urban Design District (UDD) 5. Located within District 12, the UDC was an approving body, but staff noted their purview was limited to evaluating if initial approval conditions were met with the proposed changes.\nThe new mixed-used building slated for the corner of North Fair Oaks and East Washington Avenue has gotten rid of approximately 3,300 quart feet of paved space (per the Commission’s recommendations) by reconfiguring the rounded space in front of the entrance. A playground facility was also being planned as part of the shift, further enhancing the space. The parking stall count was reduced by a single space, in addition to relocating some of the bike stalls to better connect the pedestrian pathway through the site. While challenging, the applicant team hoped their efforts would be enough to appease the commissioners. Additional trees and planting were included to bulk up the landscaping, per Commissioner Bernau’s previous comments. The applicant notes specific parts of the plan that will offer more protection for residents and offer a slightly more private space aside from areas that are meant to be open to the general public.\n\n\n\nNew parking lot site plan.\n\n\nIncreased banding has also been added to the design to make it more consistent with the rest of the building and add the desired color pop the commission wished to see. Specific to the walk-ups along North Fair Oaks, eyebrows were added above entryways per a request made by commissioner Klehr, as well as more lush and colorful planting options which were again suggested by Commissioner Bernau.\n\n\n\nCloseup rendering of walk-up entrances along North Fair Oaks.\n\n\nCommissioner Asad continued to be bothered by the overall color scheme, specifically with how the reds and yellows come down to different levels within the brick datum. He suggested the design team bring the red all the way down to the entrance canopy in order to bring an end to the “detailing nightmare.” Similarly, Alder Mayor had questions about the color scheme and clarifying that the yellow had not changed aside from the banding, which the applicants confirmed. Commissioner Asad then came back with another concern over color, this time on the townhouses which will be located behind the main building. While appreciative of their desire to break up the building face and add color, he was concerned over the proportions of the red framing around the windows—ultimately suggesting their team try to even things out.\n\n\n\nRed framing around townhouse windows.\n\n\nWithout deliberation, a movement was made to simplify the townhouse windows, adjust the red bands to remain more consistent. Commissioner Bernau jumped in to argue with Commissioner Asad over how the conditions he was proposing were tied to conditions already set in previous meetings, saying the design team had done a good job of meeting the outlines criteria. Seemingly on different wavelengths, the conversation went into awkward silence before staff jumped in to clarify the conditions that were being included in Commissioner Asad’s movement. Staff adjusted the language, the movement was seconded by Commissioner McLean, and the item was granted final approval with conditions.\n\n\nApproval of Dane County Dump Site Buildings\nOne of the quickest and easiest to digest items of the evening was Legistar 88296, regarding a public project for the new Dane County Sustainability Campus located at 7103 Millpond Road/4402 Brandt Road in District 16. As a refresher, off to the east side of the proposed site is a scale house, the west is home to the maintenance garage, and to the north is the main administrative and education building.\nAddressing UDC’s previous concerns regarding sustainability, patio areas now contain benches filled with reclaimed concrete, recycled rubber mulch rather than the previously proposed wooden option, and the patio pavers will be permeable pavers made from reduced Portland cement. There have also been several planting design changes made, which include islands for trees in the parking lot, areas not needing to be maintained by short movable grass will now be covered with native seed blends, and ornamental trees along the building have been added to break up the facade. Lastly, oak trees sourced from Dane County Heritage Oak Trees have been tentatively secured for the site.\n\n\n\nPlanting design changes.\n\n\nThe previous mechanical enclosure on the main building has had some of the screening eliminated, allowing for less distraction from the overall design. There have also been modifications made to the proportions to aid in shadow lines to give the building more depth. Soldier coursing has been increased, especially within the brick masonry, to give the building more texture and play off the wood-imitating metal siding. A double-j trim is now included to enhance the framing of the joints and help them stand out. This plays well on the desired window glazing the design team plans to use.\nMoving to the maintenance garage, the developers remind the Commission there are several constraints that prevent the applicants from doing too much to change the overall block-like design of the building. Most notably, the size of the vehicles that will be under maintenance within the building, as well as the budget limiting their team to using a pre-engineered metal structure. That being said, they have added some screening materials as close to the building as possible while keeping in mind that all four sides of the building will be driving areas for vehicles needed on the site.\n\n\n\nMaintenance shop rendering\n\n\nAs for the scale house, very few comments were made during the informational presentation. The applicant team did take another look at the siding; however, the team notes the need for wayfinding and pricing signage, which ultimately led the designers to leave the siding as is. They did update the black band at the top, adjusting it from a zig-zag to a more squared-off corner which will provide additional sheltering for employees at the window and site visitors pulling up in the vehicles.\n\n\n\nScale House rendering.\n\n\nKicking off the commentary, Commissioner Asad wanted clarification on the downspouts coming out of the maintenance garage. According to the applicants, the downspouts will be routed underground and any exposed pieces along the side of the building will have bollards to protect against vehicular damage. With little additional comment, the item was given final approval without conditions.\n\n\nInformation Presentation on The Drury Hotel Proposal\nThe first of the informational presentations of the evening went over Legistar 90072: an application for a new hotel in UMX zoning at 200 Wisconsin Avenue in District 4.\n\n\n\nStreetview rendering provided by Potter Lawson.\n\n\nThe Urban Design Commission will be an advisory body when formal applications come forward. Two buildings will be part of this overall project, though only the new development is part of this application. The neighboring building along Carol Street will be a separate process, as their team will be renovating, rather than tearing the structure down to rebuild.\n.\nThe hotel will be in a U-shape in order to both accommodate outdoor green space, as well as a drive-through dropoff zone. While the rooms themselves will not have a direct capital view, they do plan to highlight the street view down to the State Building. While the building is broken up into different material sections, it is overwhelmingly made up of an orange-tone brick masonry. There will be a series of metal brick panels, as well as additional sectioning broken up by a change in material.\n\n\n\nProposed site plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed first floor plan.\n\n\nAdditional plantings are slated for the streetscape—primarily a few planters and several trees meant to enhance the pedestrian space. The design team has also included terrace planters and rooftop plantings to not only help further break up the building scale, but add some lunch greenery in an otherwise building heavy downtown space. A service way will be included between the MATC building and the Drury Hotel for deliveries, garbage collection, and service vehicles.\nCommissioner Asad shared his concern regarding the overall appearance, advising the design team to make the building more asymmetric as the current renderings give the impression the development team was trying to keep a symmetrical appearance, but “didn’t quite make it.” Aside from that, he thought it was a very sophisticated massing of materials that has received special attention to the wrapping and paneling. Meanwhile, Commissioner Klehr asked City Staff if two curb cuts would be allowed in the downtown area. Staff explained the guidelines and conversations that will need to be had with City Traffic Engineering. That being said, UDC does have some authority in the decision making process and can provided findings that would allow for some leeway. Commissioner Klehr then asked the development team why they chose to include the double curb cut and what other options they had explored. The team responded that most taxis, hotel visitors, and guests would prefer to have a dedicated area for drop-off and pick-up; furthermore, they believed this would alleviate potential congestion from people simply pulling along the curb for briefing stops. The development team also stated that the placement is specifically meant to balance distance between stoplights, as they intend to disrupt the overall traffic flow as little as possible.\n\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr asking questions about double curb cut-out.\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr then asked if the glass along the parking area would be glazed, to which the design team responded it was currently planned to be more opaque. Agreeing with Commissioner Klehr’s concern, Commissioner Bernau agreed there might be a need for additional conversations and work—potentially putting space between the parking and windows—in order to protect the overall appearance of the building so you cannot see the parked cars from the street.\nShifting the focus to the landscaping, Commissioner Bernau stated he did not know if the plans matched the renderings. According to the plans themselves, they did not look like there would be enough space to include the trees and planters shown in the renderings. While it was not a direct concern at such an early stage of the process, he believed special attention would be needed in future updates to be sure the streetscape is being protected. Calling back to previous applications for the site, Commissioner Bernau noted additional setbacks which would have allowed for the kind of landscaping being shown to the UDC tonight.\nCommissioner McLean agreed with Commissioner Asad’s earlier statement on how the plans were a bit difficult to take in. This was especially true with materials and how they transition into one another, as well as the lighting situation. The development team responded they are still exploring additional louvers along the alleyway and stated they will have rooftop mechanical screenings.\n\n\nWest Side U-Box Facility\nThe Urban Design Commission will be an advisory body on the incoming U-Box facility included in Legistar 90065. The application calls for a major amendment to an existing planned development that was part of a General Development Plan (PD-GDP) for the Expansion of U-Haul Storage Facility located at 4716 Verona Road in District 10.\nWhen the original development was approved in or around 2011, the plan was to apply for additional approvals that would allow for a U-Box building. As such, the site’s grading was prepared as part of the original development. The new U-Box facility has specifically been designed to match the aesthetics of the area, which is primarily industrial. The design team further stated the building is meant to directly complement the existing U-Haul facility as far as colors, articulation, and elevation; however, the primary distinction will be the inclusion of “lifestyle photos” which will be painted on the side of the building facing the bike path.\n\n\n\nFacility rendering showing lifestyle photos.\n\n\nKicking off the commentary and questions, Commissioner Klehr asked for clarification on the colors and materials, with the design team stating it would be all metal paneling to match the existing facility. The change in color is simply a different paint being used, which was advised by City Staff during the initial application process so that the building better matches the existing structure. That being said, the U-Haul team also plans to have additional wood paneling to break up the metal. Commissioner Klehr was understanding of their decision, then questioned why the bathroom facilities were on the exterior rather than housed inside. The developer said they have had issues in the past with damage due to the amount of forklift traffic while moving containers around inside. Placing the facilities on the exterior is meant to not only offer protection to the water and sewerage systems but better protect customers’ personal belongings in the event of a water main being damaged.\nCommissioner Bernau then questioned the building’s setback from Frontage Road and its closeness to the bike path. The developers explained they had concerns with wayfinding if they shifted it to the front area of the parking lot. Unfortunately, they are under some site constraints given that the main building is a repurposed grocery store. This, in conjunction with customers driving larger trucks and potentially getting confused as to where they are going, led their team to use the current design. Commissioner Bernau thanked them for clarifying this is not meant to be a public-used building, since he thought more customers would be going in and out of the new addition—not just employees. Following that comment, he then asked about including more plantings to help soften the massing to give the site less of a warehouse appearance. The U-Haul team explained the amount of traffic and current pavement would make it difficult to safely and effectively include additional plantings, although they would like to be able to meet that request.\nIn a surprise appearance, Alder Figueroa-Cole joined the meeting to learn about the project as this is her district. She was unaware of its proposal until the day before it came to UDC for an informational meeting. At one point she asked the design team what the building height would be equivalent to if it were residential. Although the U-Haul team was unsure, as they do not deal with residential developments, City Staff were able to confirm it would be roughly a four-story apartment building if it were residential instead of commercial.\n\n\nRevival of The LEO at Pumpkin Hollow\nThe last informational presentation of the night previewed Legistar 90093, which is a revived and revised plan for a residential building complex at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road in District 17. The UDC will be an advisory body when a formal application comes forward.\nAlthough the development team had already done an informational meeting in December 2024, they requested a new presentation after acquiring an additional 39 acres. One of the primary differences in the site plan is a move from 200 units to 2010 units, which will still be one-, two-, and three-bedroom units. They have also adjusted the layout so residents’ windows will not be facing the blank walls of their neighbors. Additionally, they have implemented rear-loaded garages that not only allow for increased garage parking, but eliminate the larger parking structure that was a sticking point the last time they were before the UDC. Admitting they still have more work to do, the developer said they wanted to show some of the major changes that responded to requests UDC had of their previous proposal.\n\n\n\nLEO at Pumpkin Hollow Conceptual Plan.\n\n\nAccording to Commissioner Bernau, there have been a lot of improvements with the overall site plan. Following an inquiry by Alder Mayor, Commissioner Bernau asked about a series of indents along the roadways. The developers clarified they were able to reduce the amount of paved surface area by including the additional garage spaces; however, they left additional parallel parking spaces for visitors and residents. Commissioner Bernau liked the design and their decision to reduce paved space by using parallel options, rather than going with a parking lot. That being said, he pushed for more plantings and ground cover—specifically calling out junipers and ornamental shrub alternatives that would be suitable to the site.\n\n\n\nHousing preview accompanied by Commissioner Bernau.\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr wanted clarification on some of the images included in the submittal, asking if the development team wanted feedback on the architecture for the proposed buildings or if they were only focused on the site plan. The design team said they welcomed feedback for any part of the project UDC wished to comment on; however, their architects were not present tonight since they would be using the same unit designs as their original application. Commissioner Klehr politely reminded them about the appropriateness of materials and design for Wisconsin, but left any additional comments for next time.\n\n\n\nSeptember 17, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nMinutes\nTonight’s Urban Design Commission meeting was not only lengthy, but tense. Only one of the items was moved to the consent agenda and none were deferred to later meetings.\n\nConsent Agenda:\nLegistar 89631: PD-SIP (Planned Development-Specific Implementation Plan) for Heather Crest (aka Kelab Drive) Streetscape Improvements 702 N Midvale Boulevard in Urban Design District (UDD) 6, District 11.\n\n\nNo Trespass Signage at TruStage\nFirst up was Legistar 89626, concerning major alteration to an approved comprehensive design review for signage (CDR) at 5710-5910 Mineral Point Road in District 19. The TruStage applicant presented first, stating they originally received CDR in 2022, but there have been “significant campus changes,” which include the removal of two major buildings on the 27-acre property. Due to their removal, TruStage was able to establish a park-like setting. This has caused an overflow from the Garner Park area, which TruStage views as trespassing. While they have put up signs for non-affiliated people, they are asking to amend their previous approval to deter non-TruStage members due to liability and safety concerns.\n![Site Plan from Originally Approved CDR (2020).][resources/UDC_09-17-2025_01.jpg)\nCity Staff followed up, clarifying the qualifications for exceptions, citing “signage that is ultimately necessary for identification purposes due to a unique or an unusual design circumstance in the building or its location on a particular site.” Staff then reminded the UDC they need to refer back to the permissions granted by the City. Staff did not have an objection to the number of signs that triggered the CDR requirement; however, they found an issue with the need. Staff felt that TruStage could simply remove some of their existing signs to incorporate a new one, which would not need an amendment to their previously approved application.\nCommissioner McLean asked TruStage if they had other ways of deterring visitors—namely hedges, although he did not know offhand if they were allowed with the current zoning. TruStage responded by stating they had existing trees and larger shrubs that they did not want to disturb. Commissioner McLean asked if they had even thought about using plantings or even strategically placed boulders, as most people would not want to enter the site if there were obstacles. TruStage seemed particularly against landscaping, saying that they wanted the sign.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi, after some technical difficulties, asked Staff for clarification on who the “necessity” applies to in these applications. Is it the community, the applicant, the City, or the Earth? Staff Vaughn responded the issue here was the Staff FIndings, speaking to the necessity for business identification. So, the City is asking the Commission to evaluate the building’s setback, its size, speed limits, and location that could impact visibility, and topography. Essentially, they need to determine if this sign is a need for the public, or a want by the applicant. Commissioner Klehr then asked the applicant if this sign is about wayfinding for visitors or is this for deterring visitors from Garner Park. TruStage claimed this is two-fold, where they need additional identification signage as well as being a deterrent. Ten of the twelve current signs are wayfinding, and they have not explored replacing one of the two “spare” signs until their discussion tonight. Still, it appeared that the company was more interested in keeping folks off their lawn than actual identification. Picking up on that impression, Commissioner Klehr shared her thoughts, saying “not sure a sign will deter in the way it’s meant to… it’s a little vague what purpose the sign would finally serve.”\n\n\n\nCommissioner McLean motioning to say no to the application.\n\n\nCommissioner McLean agreed with Staff, in that a “it’s not gonna stop anybody,” and made a motion to place the application on file. Commissioners agreed, stating it seems the application met the first standard, but not the second. Ultimately, the application was denied by the UDC.\n\n\nRiohr Chabad House\nNext on tonight’s agenda was Legistar 81421: building addition in the Urban Mixed-Use (UMX) District at 223-225 W Gilman Street in District 2 for the Rohr Chabad House at UW-Madison.\n\n\n\nDesign Rendering of the Roger Chabad House.\n\n\nThe building is a 1920s era structure, which they hope to frame within the addition. The extra area would include additional assembly space for services, gathering space for events, and Rabbi’s retreat and office area on the second floor. There will also be additional assembly space for smaller services on the second floor. The applicant wanted to be sensitive to the existing structure and streetscape, paying special attention to the way it communicates with neighboring buildings. They have also made sure to provide access points to the outdoor areas and offer easements to neighboring structures.\n\n\n\nProposed Site Plan.\n\n\nMadison’s Bob Klebba registered as a speaker, claiming the proposing organization discriminates against the LGBTQIA+ community. Klebba reminded the Commissioner the Madison Equal Opportunity Ordinance “makes it illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation, sex, and gender identity.” He also vaguely referenced other protected classes, stating it was disturbing this group was allowed to be in Madison before apologizing to the UDC was “sorry your commission has to be associated with this proposal.”\nCommissioner Klehr asked why the proposal was made smaller, when the initial application was for a three-story addition. The applicant team enthusiastically responded, “because we listened to you!” Commissioner Klehr admitted her question stemmed from curiosity, and she is not used to applicants actually listening to their recommendation. As such, they not only scaled the proposal down, but listened to the rhythm of the street and made it a more modulated structure.\nCommissioner McLean later noted during the UDC’s discussion that this is a tight site, with Commissioner Hellrood noting he is happy with the reuse of plantings. That being said, he also noted improvements that could be made with the plant bed layouts, but overall the screening layout was fine. Commissioner Bernau, having seen the earlier proposals, agreed there could be improvements made to the plan materials and their heights in relation to the streetscapes. Still, the current design is much better than what the Commission had previously seen is was a much better contribution to the neighboring Peace Park.\nWhile Commissioner Klehr moved for initial approval with landscaping conditions, she did take the time to recognize Klebba’s concerns. She stated while the comments were outside of UDC’s preview and could not impact their decision, Klebba was seen and heard by the commission and his concern was appreciated. As such, the proposal was approved.\n\n\nMadison Saxony Apartments\nThe UDC then shifted their focus to Legistar 88527, which seeks approval for a new multi-family residential building in UMX Zoning, located at 305 North Frances Street and 533 Conklin Place in District 2.\nThe applicant team started off by stating most of the changes they were focusing on tonight were made based on feedback from previous meetings—notably those made by Commissioner Klehr that called for more design strengthening at the top. To address this, a higher percentage of tan materials have been used along the top, with more amenity framing and panels added to the structure. The applicant team has also worked to have better communication between their design and neighboring buildings, helping with the neighborhood flow, continuity, and character. Along the Conklin Place elevation, more elegant garage doors have been added, while the amount of glass has been reduced as fewer people will see it and it will not ultimately enhance the building’s appeal.\nWanting more details, Commissioner Asad asked what specifically had been changed since their last proposal, because he was not seeing anything especially noteworthy. The developer again drew attention to the tan vertical roof elements, and pointed out much of the dark blue had been replaced in order to add pops of color and texture. There was also more vertical banding with expanded width, so as not to have everything blend together and balance a stacking hierarchy. Additionally, there have been vertical wrap-arounds added for more character and, again, to break up the building a bit more. Included with the wrapping and vertical framing, a second terrace space has been added to the roof of the building, with the tan metal acting as a structural trellis.\nCommissioner Bernau requested the development team walk through their plans for the cross section on East Johnson Street. According to the applicant, the easement is about 15 feet, plus and additional foot or so from that easement up to the building. They are still working with the City to get everything finalized, but they are discussing how to fit as many trees back into the streetscape as possible, since any grass they plant is unlikely to thrive due to the high-traffic nature of the area. As of now, the easement space is double the current space and any additional space for pedestrians is in competition with plantings they may be able to do while taking into consideration the utility lines, fire hydrants, and similar utilities.\n\n\n\nMadison Saxony’s conceptual rendering showing the East Johnson Street facing side\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr questioned the site plan and asked what will be happening in the U-shape area where the three houses will remain. The developer clarified there is a dog run, which is highlighted in a light green. They made a special note to assert they took every opportunity to add green space and additional plantings where possible, and this was the perfect space to add some outdoor amenities to residents with pets.\n\n\n\nSite plan highlighting U-shape cutout to accommodate three houses which will remain untouched by the development and will be transitioned to with a dog run.\n\n\nAlthough she believed the developers had met the criteria, Commissioner Mbilinyi wanted to know more about the social components of the development. The applicant team spoke to Madison’s need for housing, and how their plan addresses not only student housing needs, but also middle and low-income families. There is also a financial component for students, where qualifying students can get a letter from the financial aid office and provide that to the management team to obtain reduced rent rates. They also drew attention to the community spaces and amenities, which will enhance a feeling of community for residents.\nAfter closing the public hearing and discussion between the members of the Commissions, the proposal was initially approved with conditions regarding the landscaping and screening screening, lighting, and detailing. Lighting will be reviewed administratively by staff before the item goes in front of the Plan commission for final approval.\n\n\nMMSD Returns with Updated Sherman and Shabazz Proposal\nFor the evening’s last item on unfinished business, the UDC revised the application for Legistar 88482, regarding a public building for MMSD at 1601 North Sherman Avenue, for Sherman Middle and Malcolm Shabazz High School in District 12.\nReturning before UDC with an updated plan, the development team spoke about additional staff and visitor parking, enhanced recreational spaces, and an updated planting plan. In an attempt to be mindful of neighbors, landscaping has been updated to screen headlights from the drop-off and pick-up areas. The team also noted their work to protect established oak trees on the property, as was previously pushed for by Commissioner Bernau. Shading was an important factor as well, as it will provide cover for windows leading into classroom spaces. Building layout has gone unchanged; however, design elements have been updated since their last UDC presentation. Architecturally, this is one building, but it does hold two independent schools. As such, Sherman Middle School and Shabazz High School have designs that communicate and flow, yet have unique identifiers to help break up the massing. Lastly, a shared common area will be situated between the Shabazz and Sherman entrances, offering a shared space for students before and after school.\n\n\n\nSouth West Perspective, showing the Shabazz High School portion of the building on North Sherman Avenue\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr asked about the materials and whether or not the blue Millenium Stainless Steel Cupped Tile is as iridescent as it appears in the renderings. The design team said it can appear that way at certain times of day with specific lighting, but overall it will be more muted.\n\n\n\nOverview of planned materials\n\n\nCommissioner Asad remarked if he went to Sherman Middle School, he would think MMSD “spent [their] last check” on Shabazz because of all the color compared to the middle school portion. The design team argues the application of color ties into the building language better than other options they explored and will compliment the Middle School’s interior as well. They further assert the rendering does not do the materials’ color justice, as there will be more variation on Sherman Middle School than the Commission realized. They apologized for the computer having trouble rendering the exact color, but assured the commission the physical building will not appear as bland.\nShading became a hot topic, with several questions asked on paneling, materials, and window sizing. The design team went over their plans, clarifying there is a metal panel being used between upper and lower floor windows. Frosted glass variations were not a viable option, due to sizing requirements and potential impacts on students’ learning; therefore, they decided to incorporate the metal panels into the window framing as an intermediate.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi, while being somewhat distracting and detracting from the overall objectives of the Commission, brought up the need to focus on the water retention efforts in order to return resources back to the community, as well as traffic filtering. City Staff redirected, detecting another potential tussle between Commissioner Mbilinyi and Bernau, reminding them of the Commission’s preview and drawing lines between where their jobs ends and City Traffic Engineering would have to step in.\nAs the public hearing closed, Commissioner Asad once again remarked on the color—stating wood does not count as a color and how easy it would be to incorporate some additional color in where the metal paneling is being placed between windows. Overall, he felt it was a good project, but he could not fully support it dues to its failure to sufficiently inspire creativity for its students. Commissioner McLean piggybacked off this thought—reminding attendees, Commissioners, and the design team that Shabazz has a different student body from the other Madison high schools. While he appreciated they were paying special attention to the building’s design considering its population, he agreed the school as a whole could be more creative and they could accentuate the Sherman Middle School section a bit more. Commissioner Hellrood was also in agreement of this, but thanked the applicant team for being sure to include a lush planting design with their proposal.\nCommissioner Klehr also latched onto color, saying “I know I’m beating a dead horse,” before latching onto Commissioner Asad’s idea to replace some of the metal panels with a more colorful material. Clearly tiring from the length of the meeting, Commissioner Bernau once again butted heads with Commissioner Mbilinyi as she began to hop on the color train. Commissioner Asad jumped in to second a motion to provide initial approval, with City Staff clarifying the recommendation moving forward would include the addition of more color in the design, specifically on the Sherman side and/or within some of the metal paneling or materials being used around the windows.\n\n\nWest Towne Mall 7-Brew\nThe evening’s only item regarding new business felt like dejavú, with a second 7-Brew location being proposed—this time for Madison’s west side. The comes to the UDC under Legistar 89441: planned multi-use site for a new two-story commercial building with a double drive-through at 53 West Towne Mall in District 9.\n\n\n\nProposed site plan\n\n\nThe applicant team is proposing taking over an overflow lot, which typically sits empty, located at the bottom of the hill at the South Gammon Road and Odana Road. The plan is to use the same design plan as what was approved for the Lein Road location, with minor modifications to accommodate signage. Again, this will be a walk-up and drive-through only building, with interior access limited to employees. Similar to their former proposal, they aim to utilize empty parking lot space with a nearby bus stop and existing pedestrian access points in order to best serve the community and their target demographic.\n\n\n\nBuilding Rendering\n\n\n[UDC_09-17-2025_11] Proposed Signage Rendering\nCommissioner Klehr notes “this applicant has been through it” as far as getting approvals previously and appreciates all of the work they have done. Commissioner Klehr was concerned over the signage size though, and questioned City Staff if their proposal would be up to code. Staff clarified they do not review signage and did not know the code for this specific location. That being said, if they needed an exception, the 7-Brew team would need to come back with another application. Thankfully, the design team knows the drill at this point, pointing out they had already evaluated the codes and their sign was within the allotted square footage.\nTurning the conversation to storm water run-off, Commissioner Bernau’s question regarding plans and zoning requirements was turned over to the project engineer. They stated they were under the threshold for a new management system and would by tying into the existing system the services West Towne Mall. They note what keeps them under the threshold is using an existing lot, which they plan to pave over.\nRepeating similar arguments from their Lein Road application, Commissioner Bernau once again advocated for less paved space by converting two entry lanes to one, which later open to two at the building. The applicant team shared their concern for traffic movement in and out of the West Towne Mall loop—which is regularly heavily congested—as well as concern over garbage and delivery trucks being able to enter the site safely.\nOverall, the applicant team was open to exploring reducing paved space, but was hesitant to commit to anything until they knew what could and could not be accommodated safely. City Staff noted City Traffic Engineering would be reviewing this soon and would likely suggest the drive through lanes to nine feet, which would help in the reduction of paved areas. The applicant lastly noted they agreed reducing space would be ideal, but wanted to keep in mind how the 7-Brew staff would be out taking orders and they would like to keep some additional space to keep employees safe.\nCommissioner Klehr, sympathetic to 7-Brew’s previous efforts, moved to approve sending the applicant team off to Plan Commission—recommending final approval, with the condition of exploring reduced paved space (pending review by City Traffic Engineering) and exchanging the lilies listed in their planting proposal with something else. The motion was seconded, and the applicant team will next present in front of the Plan Commission.\n\n\nEagle Heights Clubhouse\nUDC then shifted to a set of informational meetings, starting with Legistar 89634, an amendment to an existing planned development (PD) at 5015 Sheboygan Avenue in District 11. The application specifically aims to construct a Clubhouse Amenity Building for Eagle Heights residents, to be located just below Sheboygan Avenue.\n\n\n\nBuilding rendering provided by JLA Architects\n\n\nIn keeping with the context of the site, the design team has chosen to go with a Jefferson style building, using brick masonry and white veneer. Commissioner Klehr was curious about what looked like a turnaround around a tree in the site plan. The applicant team clarified this is an existing pavement that encompasses a monument of some type. It is included in their plan as they want to leave the site as unchanged as possible when adding the clubhouse building.\n\n\n\nSite plan for Eagle Heights Clubhouse proposal\n\n\nUDC did not have many comments, aside from adding more planting and considering the materials being used. Commissioner Mbilinyi, calling back to MMSD’s proposal, called for more color in the design to brighten up the neighborhood. The design team was reluctant to add color to the building due to the context of the location, but agreed they could incorporate more color into the landscaping. Without further comments, the applicant team was left to consider the Commission’s thoughts ahead of their next presentation before UDC.\n\n\nNew Downtown Apartments for Students\nNext up was Legistar 89583: new multi-family residential building in DC Zoning at 425 N Frances Street and 450 W Gilman Street in District 2. The applicant team presented on a proposal for student housing. He mentioned working with the Landmarks Committee, as the site is in very close proximity to the historic Grimm Book Bindery building.\n\n\n\nStreet View Rendering\n\n\nA fellow presenter went over parking plans, which include bike spaces and a focus on public-pedestrian access. In order to better service the community, the applicant team plans to reduce the frontage of the building in order to create more space for pedestrian use. While this reduces the amount of commercial and leasing office space, it provides additional outdoor square footage for those walking down the street in addition to providing more breathing room for neighboring facades. Building amenities have been added to the roof, including a pool and fitness spaces for residents to use.\n\n\n\nSite Plan, showing street setbacks\n\n\nWhile the materials are not shown on the renderings, the design team emphasized their desire to compliment the Grimm Book Bindery in terms or scale and style. That being said, they do hope to use a more modern color pallet. Exact materials and colors have not been chosen, but they hope to incorporate brass tones, ribbed metal paneling, and modular brick masonry.\n\n\n\nExpected materials Rhode hopes to use\n\n\nBob Klebba, who regularly speaks in outright opposition, spoke to say he thought the activation along North Francis was impressive. His concern was with the West Gilman portion of the development, which appears much less inviting. Klebba was also concerned with another nearby development and how West Gilman Street seems to be losing many of its pedestrian-scale buildings. Ultimately, Klebba urged the Commission to take into consideration the future of the area and how these large-scale buildings will impact the pedestrian through way that currently exists.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi began asserting for more color when City Staff reminded the UDC the Landmark’s Commission has already reviewed the proposal and will ultimately have purview over the final design in keeping with the historical context of neighboring building. As a result of Monday’s meeting, Landmarks was pleased with the overall language and massing between the proposal and the historic Grimm Book Bindery. Commissioner Asad agreed with Landmarks in the massing being proportional and appropriate; however, he was concerned about the design of the rooftop pool. While this is simply an informational meeting, they did not go into detail, but it is important to note his concern as the design is much more modern than the look the applicant team seems to be aiming for.\n\n\n\nRooftop Pool design rendering\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr tipped her hat to the structural engineers working on the pool design before questioning the building’s step backs. Specifically, she wanted to know if the new building would be meeting the Hub and if they would be blocking any residents’ lighting, or if the windows she was seeing were stairways. The applicant team clarified they were pulling their building back, as well as offering additional windows, to allow for more light to pass through and alleviate any impact it might have on renters at the Hub Apartments. The applicant team also noted the windows leading into living spaces at the Hub were designed to be street-facing. As some of the applicant team was also involved with the Hub’s planning, they were able to further clarify some of the windows Commissioner Klehr was concerned with were secondary lighting offerings, often leading into bathrooms.\nAfter some general discussion, the UDC concluded the presentational hearing, looking forward to seeing an updated plan in the near future.\n\n\nNew Mixed-Use Development on Odana Road\nThe final item of tonight’s never-ending meeting was an informational presentation on Legistar 89886, a new mixed-use building in urban design district (UDD) 3, located at 5555 Odana Road & 5534 Medical Circle in District 19. Bear Real Estate Group and JLA Architects presented their proposal to demolish two existing buildings and replace them with two mixed-use developments. The new buildings would have about seven thousand square feet of commercial space, structured parking, and two hundred and thirty, one- and two-bedroom income restricted apartment units.\n\n\n\nRendering provided by JLA Architects\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent buildings on the site and neighboring swim club\n\n\nBuilding A, fronting Odana Road, would be six stories and Building B would be five stories. The neighboring swim club would have a shared easement, meaning in the winters visitors and residents could use the space as overflow parking and in the summers the swim club could use their parking area as well. It is something the applicants think works well, mentioning City Traffic Engineering agreed this is a desirable agreement between neighboring properties.\n\n\n\nSite plan overview\n\n\nThere would be active parking spaces along Odana Road to help with commercial space traffic, as well as additional parking behind Building A which will also be used by residents. Further parking will be available below the building for residents as well.\nMoving on to materials, the desired color pallet consists of reds, whites, blues, and grays to help break up the building. This is similar to the housing development that is being completed on the former West Gate Mall site, next to Hyvee on South Whitney Way. The applicant team chose these specific colors as they felt it had a more calming effect on the overall facade and fit with the upcoming style of the neighborhood. Commissioner Mbilinyi specifically asked if this team was part of the West Gate Mall site development, to which the applicants replied no. She further questioned why their team was bringing in more parking near the pool area, producing more pollution in an area frequented by children and families. The applicant team said they are working with the easement they have inherited. This is also taking into consideration the needs of the swim club, who have specifically asked for assistance with alleviating some of the parking stress the new development would cause through the use of the easement.\n\n\n\n5555 Odana\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr asked about some of the elevations—specifically along the Odana Road facing portion of Building A. She noted how much gray was being used on the bottom level, which then continued down the grading, creating a larger, unattractive gray block. The developer noted there is a white trim they use as a break between the lower commercial space and the upper residential levels. Going off of the color pallet, Commissioner Bernau voiced his distaste for the color combinations and materials being used, as well as his concern over the project being very centered around vehicular use. He acknowledged this is just an informational meeting, but looked forward to seeing improvements in the design and outdoor spaces in future renderings.\n\n\nThe Last Stand\nThe secretary’s report—which went over a few items passed by the Plan Commission after being recommended for approval by the Urban Design Commission— was largely overshadowed by Commissioners Bernau and Mbilinyi returning to earlier tiffs from this evening. When cutting her off on one of tonight’s items, Commissioner Bernau told Commissioner Mbilinyi the UDC was not here to educate applicants, and when she began to ask for clarification he said they could discuss her confusion during the Business by Members segment.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi waited, as instructed, and stated she was concerned over having learned British English and there possibly being a language barrier. She asserted she was trying to learn and explain her questioning, not necessarily educate. Commissioner Bernau, clearly tired from the nearly five-hour meeting, stated his job as chair is to make sure the meeting stays on topic, whereas he felt her comments were distracting from the meeting’s overall progress.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi stated she felt like she was being shushed and did not appreciate it when she was trying to do what she understood was her job as a commissioner. Commissioner Bernau took offense, silencing her quickly by saying “well, I’m leaving the meeting, so I can shush you—that is my job.” Commissioner Mbilinyi offered a return, stating ”I’ll talk to Jessica about it separate offline, but you have no right to shush me, thank you.” And with that, one of the longest and spiciest Urban Design Commission meetings of 2025 came to an abrupt end.\n\n\n\nAugust 13, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Urban Design Commission met Wednesday, walking into what appeared to be a rather daunting agenda considering their typical debate time; however, the majority of the items were moved to the consent agenda. Commissioner McLean was acting chair for the meeting, as Commissioner Bernau was out for a planned absence. In addition to the somewhat unsteady footing caused by not having their usual leader, there were technical difficulties with the ‘raise hand’ function in Zoom—where some commissioners could not find and/or access the raise hand function to second motions and vote. Those who were unable to raise their hand virtually were encouraged to raise their hand physically for Staff and the acting Chair to see their votes. The out-of-the-gate confusion was only added to when Commissioner Asad recused himself from multiple items, leading to tricky maneuvering of items on the consent agenda. Legistars 89064 and 89409 were moved and passed without Commissioner Asad’s involvement before adding 89408 and passing after his seconding of the motion. Here is what passed on the Consent Agenda:\nLegistar 89064: Comprehensive Design Review for Signage (CDR) for 905 Huxley Street in District 12.\nLegistar 89409: Comprehensive Design Review for Signage (CDR) for 1003 Huxley Street in District 12.\nLegistar 89408: Comprehensive Design Review for Signage (CDR) former 4201 Buckeye Road in District 15.\n\nFinal Approval for Fair Oaks and East Washington Avenue Mixed-Use Development\nFinding their footing, the UDC moved on to discuss Legistar 87242: final approval on a new mixed-use building at the corner of 3357-3375 East Washington Avenue and 922-930 North Fair Oaks Avenue in Urban Design District 5, located in District 12.\nAlthough they raced through the item during UDC’s last meeting, the developers were asked to start fresh this time for fairness. They recapped their plans for a collection of existing commercial and residential lots that will be combined for a mixed-use building, again noting two inner parcels that will help break up the site and “add diversity” to the lot.\n\nThe developers noted the increased overall size of building one by extending it along East Washington Avenue, which allowed for additional rooftop plaza space. They have also added a six-unit townhouse building, which will have single parking garages, three bedroom units, and be two stories tall. The townhomes’ design is intended to complement building one in aesthetic, color, and material types.\nThe developer then reminded the commissioners of the added dog run in the southeast portion, as well as a privacy fence along the southeast lot line. There were also changes made to the landscaping, with the developer crediting the landscaping improvements to the missing Commissioner Bernau. Specifically, plans now include cedar trees in response to more screening from a landscape perspective. This is meant to aid in blocking vehicle headlights and some of the light pollution from nearby street lamps.\n\n\n\nImproved landscaping plan\n\n\nThe design was additionally modified to include UDC’s prior suggestion for walk-up units on the North Fair Oaks Street side; however, the developers were getting concerned about footing and the walk-ups’ foundations. This was largely driven by the sloping and grade drop, as they are trying to work within the existing grading and sidewalk so there is less disruption to the current set-up. Due to this, they are looking at rotating stairs, but cannot guarantee the walk-ups will make it into the final build.\nOn a more assuring note, the BRT will have a “strong connection” to the corner retail space and become what the developer hopes will be a “symbiotic relationship.” As such, they have enhanced the two story commercial space located in the corner of the building that sits at the Fair Oaks and East Washington intersection so there is more public space. They then added the building will be affordable housing units and they will be seeking WEDA assistance once they get closer to finishing construction.\nAs for the interior, the developer highlighted three elevators total for the building. This reflects one additional elevator since the last proposal was approved, which is meant to make the building more accessible and less cumbersome to navigate. That being said, they are still working with a garbage contractor, but the goal is to have dumpsters in the underground garage. The collection would roll them to the truck, empty, then put them back.\nShifting their focus back to the new townhouses, the developer again stated these are going to be a slightly more muted version of the main complex in order to aid in the transition into the current residential area. Essentially, they want it to be complementary, but did not want it to be a stark transition into the single home residential area located to the southwest of the development.\n\n\n\nComparison view of main building, as rendered from the North Fair Oaks parking entrance\n\n\n\n\n\nTownhouse elevation plans\n\n\nCommissioner Asad asked about the ceiling height in the townhomes and whether or not the height of the building meant the developer planned to hide a condenser on the roof. They responded that ceilings were planned to be nine feet high, with a parapet height of 28 feet. They do hope to install a condenser on the roof, but if they are unable to hide one on top of the building, they will explore adding one “somewhere around the building.” Overall, Commissioner Asad liked the design, stating “something is very vibrant and just pops with this,” and said it complements the design of the apartments well. The Commission and KBA later returned to discussing the windows for the townhomes, with some commissioners questioning placement and size. The developer walked UDC through the structural constraints they are under, as well as still needing to determine the condenser’s placement—which could impact the need for extra support and space above the windows.\nCommissioner Klehr followed Commissioner Asad’s questioning of the ceiling height by requesting clarification on the addition of 18 units to the main apartment building, asking about the scale of the type of streets it is on—specifically about lowering the elevation. The developer stated that building costs impact their ability to do more groundwork and they did not look at reducing the number of units as they are trying to recoup the building cost when considering the revenue input from rent.\nMoving on, Commissioner Mbilinyi commented how she loves the colors and is glad to see how Madison is coming together with some of the new developments; however, she questioned the white paneling being used. The developer asserted they meant to offer some relief to the darker colors used without adding too many colors to the building. Commissioner Mbilinyi pushed for black panels to highlight the other colors more, but the developer said they really wanted the white due to how muted everything looked when they did renderings with darker colors. Meanwhile, Commissioner Asad jumped in to say he actually likes it, to which Commissioner McLean agreed. Nevertheless, Commissioner Asad suggested a light gray to make it less dramatic and be a happy medium between UDC and the developer.\n\n\n\nRendering showing white paneling Mbilinyi disagrees with\n\n\nCommissioner McLean returned to the question posed by the developer about the walk-ups and current grading issues. McLean said he thought having enclosed patios would be fine if they could not safely implement the stairs, but that some outdoor space should be provided to the ground floor residents along North Fair Oaks.\n\n\n\nImage highlighting concerns over structural integrity of walk-ups\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr spoke on the pedestrian and cyclist experience in Madison, saying a lot of the new buildings have not done a good job of transitioning between commercial and residential areas. She did admit that they are completed in the same language and complement the neighboring residences well aesthetically, but that the transition for those traversing the area is rough. This led Commissioner Asad to ask about future plans for the neighborhood and how this will impact the transition from apartments into single family homes, with Commissioner Klehr mentioning another development happening across North Fair Oaks that will be four to five stories high. The two discussed how the two will communicate, with Commissioner Klehr noting that the single family homes will likely eventually be torn down and turned into complexes. Ultimately, they agreed that the building fit with future plans, even if the building heights are currently a bit disjointed and do not communicate as well now as they have the potential to in the future with new buildings.\nDue to the number of changes made from previous proposals and UDC being the approving body, the Commission moved for initial approval. KBA will come back for final consideration on the project once they have refined the townhome proportions and main building design to soften the North Fair Oaks elevation, explored color changes to the white paneling, and have made a plan to add more landscaping around the townhouses and within the parking area to make it less car-centered.\n\n\nCentral at the Forge Affordable Housing Proposal\nUp next, the Commission heard from developers on Legistar 88916, which proposes a new mixed-use building in Urban Design District (UDD) 4, located at 2150 Commercial Avenue and 2231-2235 Myrtle Street in District 12.\n\n\n\nNorthwestern corner street view rendering, provided by JLA Architects\n\n\nRachel Creek, from The Annex Group, gave some background on the developer and their initiatives. Creek highlighted their focus being an affordable multi-family housing group who is currently active in 15 to 20 states. Their newest endeavor, “Central at the Forge,” is slated to be constructed on the old Oscar Meyer lot, located near the corner of Commercial Avenue and Packers Avenue on Madison’s north side, and includes five levels of structured parking.\n\n\n\nAbout The Annex Group info sheet\n\n\nBarry Yang from JLA Architects presented their design plans, noting there will be 86 units per acre over about 2.6 acres of development and 4 acres total of land (241 total units). Their plan includes affordable one-, two-, and three-bedroom options, as well as commercial space. Due to the length of the building, JLA has incorporated two entrances, one on either end of the building, and has opted for three colors of fiber-cement material to visually reduce the building scale and break up the facade. Yang also noted the added parapets to the building’s corners to aid in breaking up the facade, as well as emphasize building ends.\n\n\n\nBuilding plans showing one-bedroom units in green, two-bedroom units in yellow, three-bedroom units in orange, and commercial space on north and south ends in red\n\n\nYang then drew attention to how one part of the parking structure is exposed to the street, leading to the decision to add metal fins to the design. This pattern was then repeated for continuity, creating both vertical and horizontal patterns in the plan. As part of a similar pattern, Yang stated JLA chose not to use red brick on the commercial sections in order to de-emphasize them and instead draw attention to the more vibrant red used on the residential sections. Ultimately, their goal was to make the commercial space non-competing with other corners as far as imagery.\nGoing back to the concerning length of the building, Yang notes the building’s somewhat odd shape. This was intended to again break up the facade, in addition to offering a respite area for a courtyard. According to Yang, the courtyard will be used to increase opportunity for social interaction by offering a barbecue area, fire pit, and benches.\n\n\n\nSite plan highlighting shape of building, parking structure location, and proposed courtyard space\n\n\nOnce JLA and Annex finished their presentation, the Commission heard from the sole public comment registrant, Kristen, who lives in the Sherman Neighborhood. Although her comment seemed somewhat lost, she stated “that’s a big building for that plot, first of all,” before making what seemed to be a complaint about the number of new buildings going up and the amount of new people they were bringing into the neighborhood. She then shifted her focus to flooding in the area, complaining about the police department being “very short [staffed]… you’re lucky if you get a phone call back.” While somewhat confusing, it appeared she was attempting to argue that the City needs to fix the flooding issues before continuing to develop much needed housing.\nCommissioner McLean let Kristen finish her time before clarifying not all of her comment is applicable to what UDC is discussing tonight. Staff joined in to recommend contacting Planning Commission and potentially getting City Engineering involved.\nCommissioner Klehr refocused the group, asking the applicant why they decided on one long building instead of multiple smaller ones. Their answer was simple: density means affordable housing, plus, having parking available meets Madisonians’ needs. They restated their attempt to break up the building by using the “S” shape, including a courtyard, and the outlay of materials. Commissioner Klehr then mentioned comments received from the other group working this site, asking about future coordination between that development and the one before them tonight.\nIn a somewhat defensive tone, Creek asked for more information. Commissioner Klehr stated Dan Seibel is the new owner of the Oscar Meyer facility and has plans for development. Specifically, the commissioner asked if the developer is working with the other landowner to coordinate at all. Ramping up their defense, Creek stated “no, this is our land, we aren’t working with them.” Commissioner Klehr clocked the tone, but stood on business, clarifying the two groups could work together to make this a more cohesive, coordinated project. Creek quickly realized she was becoming unnecessarily defensive, but stated she thinks zoning switches at the other plot to IL, but would be willing to work with them for smoother zoning and property transitions.\n\n\n\nStreet view rendering of Central at the Forge\n\n\nCommissioner Mbilinyi asked why the base looks like it’s coming halfway up the building, making it seem as if the building is cut in half in some areas. Yang argued JLA is trying to emphasize the corner in order to draw pedestrians into areas where there is either a residential amenity or retail space as a sort of undesignated wayfinding for pedestrians. Commissioner Mbilinyi clarified that she feels like there is no base articulated by the difference in material heights—specifically focusing on the facade as a whole, not just what is housing. The architect continued to argue, stating this is their version of a contemporary design. With some back and forth between the Commissioner and architect on what exactly contemporary means, they ultimately ended the conversation with an unsaid agreement to disagree.\nCommissioner McLean noted that “someplace in our hearts we all have something to say about that” with respect to the length of the building, but reminded everyone of the overall consensus this is a very long building on a very long-view, open street. Taking on the “good cop” role, he stated seeing “a little play within the canopies within the residential massing.” That being said, he agreed with fellow commissioners there needs either vertical or spatial relief; however, the more he looked at it, the more he started to like it. Commissioner McLean then asked Commissioner Klehr for her thoughts, with Commissioner Klehr stating she finds the brick halfway down on the right a bit confusing. She was not sure what was going on with the design, reassuringly adding maybe it is commercial space and she just is not understanding the plan.\n\n\n\nNortheast corner street view rendering of Central at the Forge\n\n\nYang re-stated how red brick is applied where there is commercial space on the ground floor, dark gray brick veneer is used where there is residential, then another color is used to signify building entries. Commissioner Klehr, seemingly sensing Yang’s irritation, reminded the group that this is an informational hearing, pushed her point that there is room for improvement, and urged all to take notes for future appearances with UDC.\nGoing off of Yang’s statement regarding residential entrances, Commissioner McLean asked if there is direct outside access to units—similar to the walkups UDC has been pushing for with the East Washington and North Fair Oaks development. Yang did not directly answer, but stated there are sidewalks along the roads between the buildings that offer building access. Commissioner McLean pushed his desire to see more pedestrian-human access and lively streetscapes, not just central access points, by asserting the plan needs some sort of open-air or separation.\nBefore moving into deliberation, Staff Vaughn reminded UDC this was an informational meeting and there was no action to be taken. Notes were taken on UDC’s suggestions, with commissioners clarifying their intentions. Commissioner Klehr also added there is a sense of history with this site. While it does not need to look like the old Oscar Meyer building, the developer should take into consideration the potential restoration of the older buildings; furthermore, this property should not be treated as a standalone development and should instead work with the existing structures and history of the area. Commissioner McLean mentioned plants in a clear nod to Commissioner Bernau’s absence, and Commissioner Hellrood mentioned the nearby bike trail and BRT stop. He highlighted how there is “a lot of action going on here” and wanted it to be more publicly accessible. Ending the meeting on an authoritative, but gentle note, Commissioner Hellrood directed the developers to “give that space back to the community” and make it a more walkable district that is hospitable to pedestrians.\n\n\n\nJuly 30th, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nWednesday’s Urban Design Commission meeting was incredibly short July 30th, after failing to reach quorum on time then losing quorum at 5pm. Although brief, they were able to move one item to the consent agenda and hear the final presentation on previously unfinished business before the meeting adjourned.\n\nConsent Agenda:\nLegistar 86816: 3535-3553 University Avenue and 733-737 N Meadow Lane - New Mixed-Use Building in Urban Design District (UDD) 6. (District 5)\n\n\nMixed-Use Building on East Washington Avenue at Fair Oaks\nDespite ultimately being referred to their August 13th meeting, UDC heard from the applicant team overseeing Legistar 87242: New Mixed-Use Building located in Urban Design District (UDD) 5, located at 3357-3375 East Washington Avenue and 922-930 North Fair Oaks Avenue in District 12.\nThe developer highlighted principal changes to the project—mainly the acquisition of two additional properties which will be included in the updated site design.\n\n\n\nSatellite view of two newly secured parcels\n\n\n\n\n\nNew site plan, which includes six additional townhouse units\n\n\nThanks to the new properties, developers were able to add an additional building on the southwest corner of the property. This is planned to be a two-story, townhouse style development comprised of six units with attached garages—bumping the total number of dwelling units on site to 177.\nThe developer also noted improved design to the main building, including an increase in underground parking below the main building, expansion of the rooftop plaza, and adding a dog run for residents. The developer then drew attention to the modification to the Fair Oaks side of the building, which now includes additional commercial space square footage, private entries to ground-floor units, and increased landscaping.\nWhile trying to make haste to meet the Commission’s 5pm cut-off, the developer did one final review of the building layout. In his recap, he confirmed the developers’ plans to include one-, two-, and three-bedroom units. Rounding things off and adding the cherry on top, the developer added that, based on previous input from UDC and neighborhood meetings, there will be a privacy fence installed to shield the neighboring residences, but it was not shown on the renderings for visibility reasons.\nCommissioner McLean asked Staff if they feel recommendations have been met, but Staff Vaughn encouraged Commissioners to discuss, rather than responding and having UDC blindly follow their recommendations. Commissioner McLean then asked the developers if there was any possibility for soft screening to aid in the sloping and visibility of the site on the East Washington side, west of the twelve parking stalls, butting up to the neighboring residence. [Matt] clarified, stating currently the parking stalls have not been fully approved. He and his team are working with the owner of the neighboring property to determine the best use of the space and whether or not they can widen the opening. At the moment, it is currently only available as an easement access point from East Washington Avenue.\nJust as the meeting started to pick up, Commissioner Bernau interrupted to remind UDC they have a hard stop at 5pm due to the impending loss of quorum. At first, Commissioner Bernau began to rush the Commission into making a movement; however, Staff Vaughn stepped in to remind the Chair he has the ability to adjourn meetings without making a motion, so a decision did not need to be made on this tonight. Out of fairness to the applicant team, Commissioner Bernau made a motion to refer Legistar 87242 and Legistar 88916 to their August 13th meeting.\n\n\nFor Next Time\nHad the commission been able to address the final item of the night, they would have received an informational presentation regarding Legistar 88916: New Mixed-Use Building in Urban Design District (UDD) 4 located at 2150 Commercial Avenue and 2231-2235 Myrtle Street in District 12. Alder Asad would have recused himself for this item, in addition to his recusal from tonight’s consent agenda, due to his involvement with the project.\nQuorum was promptly lost at 5pm and the meeting adjourned.\n\n\n\nJuly 16th, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper with Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Urban Design Commission convened on July 16, 2025, to address two items before them: (1) Nissan dealership signage proposal and (2) the Eastmorland Community Center and Housing development. There were no items moved to a consent agenda.\n\nRosen Nissan Signage Updates\nItem two on tonight’s agenda focused on Legistar 88729: Comprehensive Design Review (CDR) for the Rosen Nissan dealership located at 2510 W Beltline Highway in District 14. The commission reviewed Rosen Nissan’s proposal for updates as part of the “new global Nissan brand image” initiative. The dealership, represented by Richard Coss at tonight’s meeting, seeks to modernize both exterior and interior elements to improve customer efficiency and provide quicker service. While this includes some building modifications, UDC’s role tonight is simply acting as an approving body on the wayfinding and building signage.\nCoss presented plans for updated signage with a new dealership brand identification sign featuring a minimalistic design of the Nissan logo using the red, black, and white—uniform with other Nissan locations participating in the global brand refresh. Coss then reviewed the directional signage for wayfinding and exterior wall signage included in the proposal.\n\n\n\nSignage overview provided by Rosen Nissan, demonstrating signs approved by Nissan’s Corporate offices\n\n\nStaff Jessica Vaughn identified several areas where the proposal exceeds current code requirements, including Rosen Nissan’s request to update their 30 foot brand identifying sign, as well as the pillar-style signs that would be located throughout the property. Most notably, Staff Vaughn stated the Staff recommendation is to deny the proposal for the 30 foot sign. Currently, the City’s code only allows a maximum height of 13 foot signs and encourages pole-signs over block styles. Staff clarified that existing 30-foot signs were previously approved by Dane County when they were part of the Town of Madison, but in 2022 they were absorbed into the City of Madison. Since the municipal absorption, any sign changes require new approval through the current process. Currently, signs may receive updates to their face; however, body modifications to the upper portion and total replacements require conditional use approval.\nCommissioner Bernau raised questions about the distinction between ground signs and pole signs, asking whether Nissan could modify the base of the design to meet code requirements. Staff Vaughn explained while this was technically possible, Nissan preferred the block-style signs, which align with current automotive industry trends. Overall, Staff and UDC agreed the design fit with the area and industry standards and were not a concern they should continue to focus on.\nThe discussion also addressed how ground topography and grading from the beltline might justify the proposed 30-foot height versus the standard 13-foot allowance. Staff indicated that additional information from Rosen Nissan would be necessary to demonstrate visibility issues caused by topography.\nBased on feedback from Coss, the commission ultimately approved the signage proposal with modifications. While all wayfinding signage was given the go-ahead, Rosen Nissan was given two options for their brand identification sign: reduce the height to 13 feet in order to meet code requirements as part of a full replacement, or refresh the existing 30-foot sign face.\n\n\nEastmorland Community Center and Housing Development\nUDC then shifted their focus to Legistar 87894: Planned Development at 3565 Tulane Avenue for the Eastmorland Community Center and Housing in District 15. With Commissioner Bernau recusing himself due to his involvement with the development team, Co-Chair Alder Asad oversaw this agenda item.\nThe development team presented their vision for addressing the shortage of working middle-class housing through a planned development based on city guidance provided over the past 3-4 years. The project aims to create a walkable, collaborative neighborhood environment.\nTyler Crook, representing the development team, showcased significant improvements to their site plan since it last came before UDC. This included parking reorganization so areas no longer project into the central plaza, making it more usable and central to the development, flexible space design to accommodate flexible uses such as farmers markets and food trucks, enhanced landscaping to incorporate significantly more greenery, and historic preservation with the inclusion of an old spire from the existing building, which will be converted into a sculpture to honor the original structure.\n\n\n\nSite perspective comparison showing visual used in the informational presentation to UDC and the updated, current proposal\n\n\nThe design also includes several amenities to residents and community members—namely thirty-eight bike stalls distributed throughout the site, individual residential entries on the Ogen Street portion of the building, and a comprehensive lighting design. Crook took the opportunity to highlight the pole LED lights in parking areas, wall sconces, and rope LED lighting under plaza seating.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi, an experienced practicing licensed architect, praised the development team for their thorough research and consideration. She noted the thoughtful approach to maximizing space usage while addressing critical community housing needs, stating this was clearly a well thought-out design and previous comments by UDC had been taken to heart. Although it was left unsaid, it was clear the UDC was proud of fellow Commissioner Bernau’s landscaping design choices.\n\n\n\nCommissioner Bernau’s landscape planting plan\n\n\nAlder Asad also acknowledged the project’s improvement from previous designs, but questioned the use of a white panel that appears unique to a section with six windows. While recognizing the overall progress, he felt this material choice seemed out of place with the rest of the design. Commissioner Mbilinyi agreed with the concern but understood the design intent to use white material for highlighting building height and providing spatial relief in the overall composition.\n\n\n\nBuilding design renderings, which Alder Asad referenced when commenting about the unique white sections of the building (most notable in the top middle and direct middle panels of the image)\n\n\nBefore UDC voted, Alder Rutherford provided strong district-level support for the development, emphasizing that it targets a demographic in dire need of housing. They highlighted the project’s value in creating a walkable community with worship, shopping, and community amenities in a working-class area that needs both housing and community spaces. Alder Rutherford also spoke on a personal note, stating how difficult it has been for them recently in the search for housing not just in the city, but especially in their own district.\nDespite the procedural challenge of having both the co-chair Alder Asad presenting (making him a non-voting member) and Commissioner Bernau recused, the commission achieved the necessary three-vote minimum for approval. The motion to recommend approval to the Plan Commission passed unanimously among eligible voting members.\n\n\n\nJune 25th, 2025\nUrban Design Commission Denies Oversized Projecting Sign for Whitney Way Development\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Urban Design Commission held a focused meeting to review signage plans for the residential development at 655-667 S Whitney Way, ultimately denying one component of the proposal due to size restrictions.\n\nWayfinding Signage Proposal\nThe evening’s meeting centered entirely around Legistar 88670: Comprehensive Design Review for Signage for a development at 655-667 South Whitney Way/601, 625, 649 Sand Pearl Lane located in District 11.\nDevelopers Mary Beth and Danny presented their wayfinding signage plan for the Whitney Way buildings, designed to help residents, guests, and contractors navigate the property more easily. The signage proposal was part of a larger project to improve identification and navigation throughout the development.\nCity Staff member Jessica Vaughn outlined the city’s signage requirements, noting that exceptions may be granted for identification purposes in special circumstances. These exceptions typically apply to skyscrapers, buildings with significant setbacks, or signs along busy roads where higher traffic speeds limit visibility.\nThe primary issue centered on a proposed 31.55 square foot projecting sign. Staff Vaughn expressed concerns that this sign did not meet the requirements established by city zoning codes and questioned its necessity for the development.\nCommissioner Klehr sought clarification about which buildings constituted the “West Bend” development, with staff confirming that only the 655-667 addresses were included in this designation.\nCommissioner Bernau inquired about the modification process, which allows developers to request up to 50% more than standard height, size, and setback requirements for signage; however, this would require a separate application and approval from the Urban Design Commission.\nCommissioner Asad observed that obtaining building approval seemed easier than securing signage approval, prompting discussion about the city’s flexibility in evaluating appropriateness. Matt Tucker explained that the commission was specifically convened to review the projecting sign, as all other proposed signs were compliant.\nTucker emphasized that approval for a 32 square foot projecting sign was unlikely based on existing code, particularly given the building’s location and the speed limit on S Whitney Way, which would make signs above 18 square feet inappropriate.\nWhen Commissioner Graham asked about the size selection, representatives from Ryan Signs explained their methodology. They conducted site visits with developers and drove by the location multiple times, determining that a 12-foot sign was difficult to see from the street. The team performed various exercises to simulate how applicants, visitors, and others would view the signage.\nBoth Jessica Vaughn and the commission acknowledged that while the 12-foot sign appeared undersized relative to the building, the proposed 31.55 square foot sign exceeded code requirements.\nThe commission clarified that they had no issues with the design or placement of the projecting sign—only its size. Tucker suggested that rather than an outright denial, the city should provide specific reasons for rejection and allow the developer to return with a new proposal and application.\nThe other signs in the proposal were deemed compliant and required only standard permits. The projecting sign was the sole item requiring denial.\nA motion to deny the oversized projecting sign was made, seconded, and passed unanimously.\n\n\nCommission Changes\nFollowing the agenda’s conclusion, Commissioner Harry Graham announced his resignation and recused himself from the remainder of the meeting’s voting.\nThe commission also conducted its biennial chair elections, held during odd years in June. Commissioner Bernau was nominated and selected as chair for another term, while Commissioner McLean was nominated and chosen as vice chair.\n\n\n\nMay 28th, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Urban Design Commission convened May 28th for a rather entertaining and lengthy meeting, despite moving multiple items to the consent agenda and only having three main areas of focus. The meeting began with the introduction of Nick Hellrood, UDC’s newest member. Commissioner Hellrood is a student at UW-Madison studying Landscape Architecture while interning at Psyche Design. Once the introduction concluded, Staff transitioned the meeting to their usual agenda overview.\nTwo items were moved to the Consent Agenda and passed unanimously:\nLegistar 88015: Signage Exception for 102 E Rusk Avenue located in District 14.\nLegistar 88143: Amending section 31.041 of the Madison General Ordinances, Sign Permits and Fees, to create a new application fee and deadlines for processing sign permit applications. UDC is an Advisory Body to the Common Council.\nIt is worth noting 102 East Rusk Avenue, the subject of Legistar 88015, is on an elevation that does not qualify for signage as it is not located on a street, nor is it associated with a parking area tied to the building. Staff supported the request because there is no current signage identifying the business that may be approached from the John Nolan Drive access point, which UDC ultimately agreed with.\n\nMixed-Use Development on University Avenue at Meadow Lane\nMoving on, UDC shifted their focus to Legistar 86816: New mixed-use building in UUD 6, located at 3535-3553 University Avenue and 733-737 North Meadow Lane in District 5. UDC is an approving body on this request and Commissioner Asad recused himself from the item due to his involvement with the project.\nMultiple members of the design team presented, starting with Pat Terry from JLA Architects. Terry gave a plan overview for the five-story building, stating plans included 246 residential units, rooftop amenities such as a pool and community room, as well as two levels of below-grade parking. Terry also mentioned two current parking areas, which have plans for being combined in order to meet zoning code requirements. Another member of the development team chimed in to remind UDC of a smaller project that was approved last year, but they took what was approved and extended it to the west using the same architectural language.\n\n\n\nFormerly approved project and new/updated proposal renderings\n\n\n\n\n\nFormerly approved project and new/updated proposal renderings\n\n\nAndrew Gifford with JSD then shifted the presentation’s focus to more technical aspects of the project, informing the Commission that they have adjusted their plans to move sanitary and storm sewers around the building, whereas they were previously designed to be to the west, but have now been moved to the east side of the building. Gifford also notes the addition of more landscaping—including more shade plants, trees, and shrub buffers for patio areas.\nA fourth member of the development team clarified interior building plans, stating levels 2 through 4 are residential spaces with one- and two-bedroom options. The first floor has included commercial space with an outdoor patio, which is an included amenity for businesses renting the space. The developer also added that after the last informational meeting with UDC, the building was redesigned to include more building breaks using facade gaps, or hyphens, as well as recessed upper floors and material changes.\nKate, a local resident, along with several neighbors, submitted written concerns regarding the impacts the development would have on traffic. While she recognized this was outside of UDC’s purview, she wanted to make UDC aware their group has been sending out concerns to the various commissions, committees, and units that would be involved in the approval process. Specifically, they are requesting things such as the consideration of a right turn only onto University Ave, as well as other traffic calming measures such as bump-outs, roundabouts, and stop signs.\nCommissioner Bernau asked if developers were able to move the building back to the south at all, as mentioned in their previous critique when this originally came before UDC. The development team said no, but walked UDC through ways they have tried to offer points of relief in the building in order to make the building less daunting to pedestrians. This included adding depth and breaks—namely the hyphens—as well as offering more shrubbery and green spaces to give it a more comforting feel.\nCommissioner Bernau also referred back to the fencing materials discussed in the previous informational meeting, asking about the grading and topography, in addition to the materials that would be used. The development team responded by focusing on the retaining wall, which is planned to be comprised of wooden lag. It will then be covered by another, more decorative fence along Bruce Court to add to curb appeal. On the west, they have a low, modular block retaining wall to aid in the grade change.\nAnother member of the development team chimed in to clarify that different zoning requires privacy fences. They plan to install a six-foot, wood-type privacy fence to meet that requirement and would be placed along the zoning change line. Commissioner Klehr asked for clarification on the plan design, with the developer noting the “break” in the fence she sees is a transformer box for electrical flow. Commissioner Klehr also asked about an access point between University Ave and Bruce Court, but developers said this idea was shot down during neighborhood meetings, as most residents did not want the extra traffic that would be brought in.\nCommissioner McLean asked for more information about the windows, wanting to know if there is any relief in the frame of the glass or any type of framing. The development team stated the design calls for a thin brick veneer, but they have included panels below the windows to give the building more depth. They have not picked a manufacturer yet for the windows, but they aim to get something that will articulate the brick and offer relief, rather than making it into a flat facade. All windows will be operable, double hung designs. Commissioner Klehr later asked about the glazing on the lower windows, stating she believed the potential glare into traffic and neighboring buildings/residences warranted the issue being addressed.\nStaff believed initial approval would be acceptable in this case and that any concerns brought up by UDC tonight could be addressed at later meetings, rather than denying the item tonight and bringing it back with a more lengthy discussion later. Initial approval would mean only coming back before the Commission to address concerns later, which would make this a much more efficient process.\nCommissioner Graham moved to approve, with conditions regarding window glazing, revisions on lighting, and access points in the fence, as well as the fencing material and security. The motion passed.\n\nFacade Alterations on Gilman Street\nMoving on to the evening’s hottest topic, the Commission reviewed Legistar 88343: Major facade alterations at 430 W Gilman Street, located in the Downtown Core District (District 2), where they acted as an approving body.\nThe applicant team seemed to be out of their depth, although they appeared to be providing as much information as they could on the proposal. Essentially, the requesting body wanted to change the location’s color to make the building more uniform with surrounding buildings, referring to the structures immediately next to the site and The Hub apartments, as well as fight the never-ending slew of graffiti the building obtains. The building has already been painted previously without approval, as well as had tiling installed on the front facade, but it was unclear when and what products were used.\n\n\n\nBuilding facade alterations on Gilman Street\n\n\nThe applicants have contacted several pressure washing companies to see about removing the current paint, but no one would touch it. Most companies said to either get approval from the City for repainting, or to get approval for exterior changes in the event they moved forward with pressure washing and needed to repair the structure. The requesting team later clarified that the companies would not be able to water- or sand-blast due to damage concerns, as well as the fact the building was built prior to 1978.\nWhen contacting painting companies, the applicant team was able to find one that would agree to complete the job, despite the tricky tile that was previously added to the front of the facade. They were also able to find a gray that matched the neighborhood’s aesthetic; however, they quickly came to the understanding they had been misinformed by the building landlord and would need to seek UDC approval prior to proceeding.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi asked for clarification from the requestors’ previous statements on the landlord claiming there was no zoning approval needed for the project. UDC had concern over the false statements, but was glad to see this item had in fact made it before the Commission. The requestors asked for recommendations on companies to help complete their project. UDC is not able to recommend companies, but was able to refer them to other applicants who had successfully completed projects after gaining approval from the City in the past.\nCommissioner McLean was able to provide some guidance on paint, explaining how damaging paint is to brick and mortar structures like this. As part of his explanation, he went over how paint prevents porous brick from breathing and traps moisture—leaving damage that often cannot be seen until it is too late. Commissioner McLean emphasized the significance of the damage and this proposal coming before UDC, as this is not only an aesthetic issue, but can impact the building’s structural integrity. Commissioner Mbilinyi echoed McLean’s concerns over structural integrity, again drawing the attention back to the landlord’s false statements about the approval process and building code before making a statement that the architects should also have known better.\nCommissioner Bernau then redirected, essentially stating how they got here is not as significant as what UDC does moving forward. This led Commissioner Graham to propose stain as an alternative to re-painting before UDC transitioned into discussing suitable movements and action on the item.\nCity Staff Tuttle mentioned that, had the landlord been aware of programs offered by the City, this site may have been eligible for graffiti removal; however, now that the building had been painted, those grants do not cover paint removal. The building is now in a situation where they will have to continue to paint over the graffiti that gets added to the building over the paint as it is now considered property management costs.\nThis led to a somewhat argumentative discussion between Commissioners, where they bickered over what falls under their prerogative, as well as where exactly this building’s unique situation falls on UDC’s approval spectrum. Ultimately, nothing of substance came from this brief break-out, but it was mentioned that UDC is able to approve or deny the use of specific materials or colors.\nCommissioner McLean went back to the staining option, adamantly arguing that older buildings should not be painted due to the concerns over damage and impact on structural integrity. Commissioner Klehr then joined the bickering a bit late, but made her argument relevant to the discussion, stating brick should never be painted. Commissioner Klehr referenced a tattoo shop on University Avenue who painted their sign on masonry some years back and an auto body shop who requested to add stripes to the top of their brick building—both of which were vehemently denied by UDC when most of the current members were not sitting on the Commission (aside from Commissioners Asad and Klehr).\nOverall, there was quite a bit of confusion between UDC and the requestors, as there were several pieces of key information missing, the requestors did not seem to be experts on the project, and UDC continually bickered back and forth over what should be done moving forward as they questioned the situation.\nCommissioner Asad asked if UDC was ready for a motion; however, Commissioner Mbilinyi brought up concern over how much time was spent on paint, without addressing issues surrounding the tiles. Staff Vaughn quickly stepped in to redirect the conversation back to Commissioner Asad’s motion, before admitting “this is a big one… this is a little tricky, because our motion is going to treat this like it hasn’t been done even though it has been.”\nStaff Vaughn stated their suggestion would be a motion to deny in order to have the previous paint removed, but it was up to UDC if they wanted to focus on approving further painting, staining, or similar facade alterations once the paint is removed. Commissioner Bernau disagreed with approving future projects and Commissioner Asad concurred—a first for the night between the two. UDC concluded that the requestors needed to come up with a plan on their own and come back to the Commission with a new, comprehensive design package. Staff Vaughn agreed “that’s perfect” but that all other design considerations would need to return to UDC for approval.\nUltimately, the application was denied. The requestors will be required to remove the current paint and apply at a later date with a full design package. Alder Mayor thanked the requestors for their commitment to fighting graffiti and improving the building. Commissioner Mbilinyi echoed the sentiment, adding she understood the difficulties of the requestors not only being new to Madison, but also not being native English speakers—ultimately encouraging them to keep advocating for their building.\n\n\nDane County Sustainability Campus\nThe final item of the night was Legistar 88296: a public project set for 7103 Millpond Road/4402 Brandt Road to accommodate the new Dane County Sustainability Campus in District 16. UDC acted as an approving body for this item.\nJohn Welch presented first for the development team, reviewing plans for a new landfill and sustainability campus on a site that was purchased from the eastern portion of the Yahara Hills Golf Course two years ago. Welch explained the plans include critical infrastructure such as scale building and maintenance shop, as well as an administrative and public education building.\n\n\n\nMap of proposed layout for the new Dane County Sustainability Campus\n\n\nAustin Conrad, the project manager, spoke next. Conrad showed UDC the site’s location, which would be across the beltline from the current landfill. While the development will be separate from the landfill, the project is directly related. He also went over traffic plans, as they have spent a considerable amount of time evaluating the safety of the direction and flow.\n\n\n\nTraffic direction proposal\n\n\nAnother member from the development team went over their landscape approach, stating they wanted to focus their planting design to be “low-input to make it easier to maintain by staff.” They highlighted the use of several native plants, the inclusion of shrubs and dense evergreens, in addition to a significant number of trees to provide shade and soften the location’s appearance. He then went over plaza and patio space, which will have flex-use throughout the year for their trash lab, general use, public education, and more.\n\n\n\nLandscaping plans for the new Dane County Sustainability Campus’s Main Building\n\n\nThe development team continued by reviewing the main building’s layout, highlighting the spaces intended for educational programs. Building plans include lobby spaces, a community room, and educational classrooms. The rest of the building is meant for administrative services, with the second floor consisting of changing rooms, offices, and workspace. Developers also noted there is a screen wall included on the rendering, which provides some respite for machines and vehicles that need to be regularly stored outside of the building.\nAlec Kendry then went over the plans for the maintenance shop, which will have a uniform roof, but multiple bays with varying garage door sizes to accommodate specific equipment. Kendry also pointed out a second structure located behind the shop, which will act as a sort of carport for vehicles not currently being serviced. Returning to the shop’s design, the roof will be sloped to the south in order to utilize solar power panels. He also mentioned the windows on the garage doors will be above eye level, indicating it was more of an aesthetic choice than utility. Commissioner Asad later suggested looking at gutter placements, but overall liked the plans.\n\n\n\nRendering of proposed maintenance shop\n\n\nFinally, the development team moved on to the scale building, which includes a 270 degree window view, so operators can easily identify vehicles coming to use the weigh station.\nCommissioner Mbilinyi questioned the development team on their material and color choice for the main building—stating there was no articulation in the design. She thought the scale building was “beautiful” but did not think the main building’s design met the standards set by its smaller counterpart. Commissioner Mbilinyi’s opinion was that there was too much blocking, which led her to suggest a base or some other sort of respite to articulate the building. She reassured the developers the main building was also “beautiful,” but thought it could be improved to match the level of the scale building.\n\n\n\nRendering of the Scale Building for the Campus’s Weigh Station\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering of the Main Building to be used for administration and education\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr agreed the buildings are “handsome” but questioned sustainability measures, noting how most newer developments of this scale are incorporating more eco-friendly measures. The developers responded by stating they are looking at using all recyclable materials, mentioned again their desire to include solar panels, and were even open to using already recycled materials when next asked by Commissioner Bernau.\nCommissioner Bernau immediately clarified his desire to see something bold and impactful, not just token items. The developer assured him they plan on using recycled concrete in certain, non-structural sections and are open to incorporating additional recycled materials where possible.\nIn the end, UDC approved the application.\n\n\nA Farewell to a Member of the “Skeleton Crew”\nEnding the evening’s long meeting, Commissioner Graham announced his plans to step down at the end of June, citing a new job and his hope that someone who can dedicate the proper amount of time to the Commission that it deserves will fill his spot.\n\n\n\n\nMay 7, 2025\nby Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nWednesday, May 7th had a concise meeting after moving two of the three agenda items to the consent agenda, for both of which UDC was the approving body. The only topic up for discussion focused on updates to a previously approved plan for a development on East Washington Avenue. For the second meeting in a row, there was electrical feedback at the start of the meeting which made it difficult to understand what was being said—namely Commissioner Asad’s recusal from the evening’s public hearing item. Staff noted they would reach out to IT to resolve the issue ahead of UDC’s next meeting.\n\nItems Passed Unanimously on tonight’s Consent Agenda:\nLegistar 87952: Amendment to an Existing Comprehensive Design Review for Signage at 1849 Wright Street on the Madison Area Technical College campus in District 12.\nLegistar 87953: Comprehensive Design Review for Signage at 531 West Washington Avenue in District 4.\n\n\nUpdates to an Already Approved Proposal\nOn to the evening’s main course, the Commission heard from JLA Architects regarding Legistar 87954, requesting alterations to a previously approved mixed-use building in Urban Design District 8, which will be located at 702 East Washington Avenue in District 6.\n\n\n\nUpdated Building Rendering Showing New and Improved Design Proposal\n\n\nThe familiar Troy Jacoby presented for JLA after additional technical difficulties joining the Zoom meeting. The City initially sent the developer team a link to the wrong meeting and had to send a new one. Even then, there were issues with Jacoby not receiving the email and needing to have a fellow JLA member forward the updated link to him in order to join and present.\nNevertheless, Jacoby hit the ground running, catching the UDC up on updates JLA has been making to the design over the past year since they were last before the Commission.\n\n\n\nComparison of previously approved proposal and updated design\n\n\nJacoby noted the two story plinth “with a really activated street front” is largely unchanged; however, there are reduced percentage openings on the upper half due to the unit layouts. The smaller windows are meant to accommodate building performance, energy efficiency, and to offer less restrictive options for residents’ furniture layouts.\nLooking specifically at the exterior design, JLA has opted for railings instead of dividers on the balconies, which allows more natural lighting into the units. There is also increased texture, additional colors, and overall more personality on both the north- and south-facing sides of the structure. Jacoby also notes a change to a “totally secured parking deck” with no openings, unlike previous design which left vehicles and a portion of the structure exposed to the elements. In the same vein as parking, the developer has introduced loading a dock on back elevation for service deliveries into building.\n\n\n\nSide view rendering comparing original, approved design and updated proposal\n\n\nLooking at the side views, Jacoby assured the Commission JLA would still be using metal panels, but stated there were changes in the dimensions. For one, recessed balconies were reduced to put that square footage back into the units and aid in the utilization of natural lighting in the units. Recessed lighting was also added for increased nighttime visibility without hindering the overall design and building functionality.\nThere were also changes made along the Blount street facade, where JLA has introduced color-matching louvers to the design. Although they must keep the service doors for MG&E, they worked to increase the artwork size, as well as decided to frame it with metal sheeting to add emphasis.\n\n\n\nInfographic highlighting changed made in the proposal, noted by the red dashes\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr asked about the durability of the metal and JLA’s experience working with the material. Jacoby reassured the UDC by stating they were familiar with the materials in the proposal and have recently done a project on Regent Street which used one of the two proposed metal options—specifically the Centria siding. While they had not worked with their second option, Muza, the only difference would be the flatness. JLA proposed two options due to concerns over recently imposed tariffs, which could cause them to not only run into budget issues, but supply chain troubles as well.\nCommissioner Klehr seemed pleased with Jacoby’s ready response, but quickly moved on to question the “eyebrow” created by the thicker canopy over the storefronts, asking why JLA made this change. The developers pointed out how the garage is situated directly above the store fronts and explains concerns over vehicles tracking in rainwater or bringing snow into the parking structure. The increased canopy volume not only offers more surface area for run-off, but provides additional support for the retail area windows.\nIn a turn of events, and Commissioner Klehr having enjoyed a light-hearted interrogation, she noted landscape changes. Although she ultimately referred the landscaping critiques to Bernau, she mentioned an appreciation for going through the pains of making changes in order to accommodate the building needs. Right on cue, Commissioner Bernau jumped in, but threw another UDC curveball by stating he thought “the planters and railings are actually nicer in the new proposal.” Commissioner Bernau also voiced his appreciation for the artwork and how it interfaced with the streetscape, despite the interruption by the garage doors and loading dock.\nAs the Commission moved to approve, Staff Vaugh noted that if approved as-is, both Muza and Centria metal options would be approved—meaning JLA could use whichever they decided to go with in the end. This led Commissioner McLean to jump in, stating he agreed with using Muza if possible, but Centria would be acceptable if they needed to go that route. The Commissioners agreed and the motion passed unanimously.\n\n\nNasty Grahams to the Urban Design Commission\nAs part of their business by members, Commissioner Klehr asked how the UDC should be responding to emails critiquing their meetings and decisions. There was also concern over personal email information, such as emails and phone numbers, being shared outside of the Commission—which would make it easier for UDC members to be contacted through personal accounts, rather than Madisonians reaching out through official channels.\nWhile the UDC ultimately decided individual members of the Commission should not reach out, it was clear there was one particular email that had raised concern. While information regarding the specifics was not shared, it was clear to those tuning in to the evening’s meeting there was some tomfoolery afoot. While this author cannot speak for Madison n Councilytics, she can say on a personal note she thinks UDC should spill the tea.\n\n\n\nMarch 5, 2025\nby Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nUrban Design Commission discussed two new proposals with developers, both located on East Washington Avenue. Before getting into the thick of things, the Commission passed one item from their consent agenda:\n\nLegistar 87165: Comprehensive Design Review for Signage in an Urban Design District (UDD) for a property located at 849 E Washington Avenue and 10 S Paterson Street in District 6.\n\n\n3361-3375 East Washington Avenue\nMatthew Tills, with the proposal’s developer JSD, previewed their plans for a 153 unit apartment building at the corner of North Fair Oaks Avenue and East Washington Avenue. The building was not up for any official approval. The proposal is to develop a new mixed-use building in Urban Design District 5, located in District 12 Legistar 87242. The property is currently broken up into seven parcels, made up of two single-family homes and a small strip mall–which JSD proposes replacing with a single mixed-use building. After meeting with neighbors, JSD has included more parking in the plans. It would have a total of 142 parking spots. The parking lot would allow for entry and exit from both directions on Fair Oaks, but would only allow for right-hand entry from and right-hand exit onto East Wash in order to comply with current traffic flow. The lot is also being designed to accommodate parking for a proposed commercial space. The plan also includes a courtyard, which provides additional green space to tenants and private entry patios with some green space in front of each ground-level unit to indicate private use. Tills later mentioned the possibility of including railing on patios to further indicate the spaces as private to tenants and discourage loitering from members of the public who may be waiting for a bus. This would be in addition to the developers incorporating as much greenery to the landscape as possible, including a significant number of shrubbery, plants, and trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Landscape overview of proposed apartment building at 3361-3375 East Washington Avenue\n\n\n\nCommissioner Klehr, who was the most vocal about accessibility and planning for the project, noted she can “appreciate [the] sophistication and color” the developer is proposing; however, she brought up concerns over the transition from a commercial to residential area. She then questioned why JSD is not stepping down the height of this development where it is adjacent to low density residential, similar to their previous work with the Rise Development. While Tills did not provide a direct answer, he did reassure the Commission JSD would be willing to step the building down if it would be critical to the project’s approval. While Klehr agreed the mixed-use space was in accordance with the North East Plan, she expressed hopes for more commercial space in order to make the area more walkable for residents. Klehr additionally requested further consideration on JSD’s part of how the color scheme would impact lighting in the area–specifically how the colors would either absorb or throw light that hits the building and impact the transition into a residential area from a high-traffic area.\nCommissioner Klehr also referenced the space at the intersection of Fair Oaks and East Wash that would be used by pedestrians utilizing the nearby BRT stop. Klehr requested consideration for more maneuverability, as she expects higher traffic on that corner for public transportation users. Tills was amenable to the change, stating the nearby BRT stop was critical in JSD’s plans and how it is “symbiotic for urban transport.” This later brought into question how the parking area would accommodate pedestrians using it as a shortcut between the two streets. In response to further questioning by Commissioner Klehr, Tills confirmed that City Traffic Engineering has been involved with the project as part of a meeting held with neighbors at the end of January. Tills said they are still working on the exact parking layout, but want it to be safe for pedestrian use while maximizing usability for the commercial spaces which will make up the lower level of the project. Alder Rummel chimed in to question additional parking in the area, namely street parking availability. Tills informed the Commission there is not immediate street parking next to the development site, but there is available street parking further south on Fair Oaks.\nBefore bringing the discussion to a close, Commissioners Graham and Mbilinyi advocated for additional public and private spaces on the exterior of the building. Commissioner Mbilinyi asked for further consideration of an expanded patio area, while Commissioner Graham drew specific attention to the plan’s inclusion of patios with step downs on the East Wash side, but not the Fair Oaks facing portion of the building. Tills confirmed Commissioner Graham’s suspicion the site’s topography was a factor; however, Tills noted JSD was working with civil engineering to explore the possibility of either individual or shared patio steps to allow for private or semi-private entry on the Fair Oaks side.\n\n\n501 E Washington Avenue\nAnother development proposal was for a parcel located between East Washington Avenue, South Blair Street, and South Franklin Street. Steven Rosemitch, from JLA Architecture, previewed the design plan for the 223 unit residential building, which is set to be located in Urban Design District 4, in District 6 Legistar 87243. It was not up for any official approval. Rosemitch specifically highlighted how JLA would be addressing specific aspects of the proposed development’s location and topography. For one, there is a considerable grade change on South Blair. Due to this, JLA has decided to adjust their plan to have the building’s lobby on South Franklin so as to promote accessibility and avoid sending traffic onto East Wash. To aid in the curb appeal of the South Blair side, JLA included plinth in their design in addition to the strong masonry base, which will be used to add contrasting greenery to the area. Secondly, the building has been designed to frame the capital as you come up East Wash—promoting the view and staying compliant with City height ordinances while maximizing residential space in a high-housing-need area. Additionally, parking would be included under the building. Commissioner Bernau later questioned the exact location and if the windows seen on the lower level would look into a garage, to which Rosemitch clarified parking would be below the window line (seen in figure 3), underground.\nCommissioners were skeptical of the proposed design and how it fit into the area. Commissioner Bernau questioned Rosemitch on zoning requirements regarding transitioning down the South Franklin side of the building into a historic district. Rosemitch said he was not aware of any, with Staff member Jessica Vaughn clarifying the site is zoned as Urban Mixed Used (U-MX) and there are no requirements for zoning transitioning into the First Settlement historic district. This brought further scrutiny from the Commission, as several other members brought up design context in regard to the much smaller historic buildings and homes adjacent to the parcel. Commissioner Mbilinyi jumped in to draw attention to how overbearing the building plans appear in comparison to others in the area, which was echoed by Alder Rummel who advocated for toning the building down. Commissioner Bernau additionally argued the need to consider the smaller structures in the First Settlement—impacting the Urban Design Commission’s judgement of scale and size of the proposal when thinking about how the development fits into this neighborhood, as those historic buildings are likely to remain for a considerable amount of time. Alder Rummel agreed, noting historic landmarks take legal precedence. Vaughn then reminded the Commission they will be both an approving and advisory body on this matter, with sensitivity of context as well as compatibility needing to be considered moving forward. Vaughn again referenced current zoning as U-MX, so the development will likely require conditional use approval from the Plan Commission with regard to context and sustained aesthetic desirability.\nMultiple members of the commission also expressed interest in JLA offering a design that included two more modest buildings, rather than a large, single structure. Commissioner Klehr commented that although she agreed, she liked that the design “snaked around” to create a courtyard space. This led to Commissioner Mbilinyi noting how small the proposed courtyard appears, with Commissioner Bernau asking for clarification on the purpose of such a narrow courtyard on the interior of the design. Rosemitch informed the Commission the original design had the courtyard facing East Wash; however, JLA determined the back end of the building would make better use of the space. The updated design would allow for more facade space, as well as increased sunlight to otherwise interior units—ultimately aiding in breaking down massing of the building. Rosemitch also noted the original design included more balconies, but after a neighborhood meeting JLA reduced balcony sizes and recessed their settings to increase courtyard space.\nAll in all, while the Commission like certain aspects of the design, just about every compliment was followed with a “but.” Bernau commended the inclusion of plinths in the design, but stated this area is not well suited for lawn, pushing for JLA to consider perennial and shrubs instead. Commissioner Mbilinyi said vertical massing was appropriate, but was not pleased by the horizontal aspects. JLA boasted their color and material choice to help break elevations and create shadow lines—only for Alder Rummel to flatly state she does not think the material is appropriate for the area and the colors are too dark, but she did think the corner design was strong. Staff commented that the developer is tasked with bridging context between the East Wash developments and the First Settlement on South Franklin as they have two very different profiles and aesthetics. This was highlighted in the Staff Report, which noted the challenge of transitioning between two contrasting areas and drawing into question which design takes priority while establishing a way to make the designs coalesce. As a middle ground proposal, Staff suggested the development look like multiple buildings, similar to their previous Core Space Development between East Gorham Street, South Broom Street, and East Johnson Street.\n\n\n\nFebruary 19, 2025\nby Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Urban Design Committee convened February 19th to unanimously pass the evening’s consent agenda and review two additional items: a new office-warehouse building proposal in District 16 and plans for the 7 Brew coffee application slated for District 3.\n\nConsent Agenda:\n\nLegistar 86819: Exterior modifications to an existing public building in Urban Design District 8, located at 1 South Ingersoll Street in District 6.\n\n\n\n5001 Femrite Drive\nA new office building is proposed for the corner of Femrite Drive and Dairy Drive on Madison’s east side, sitting in Urban Design District 1 of District 16 Legistar 86819. According to WYSER Engineering, the plan includes demolishing nearby buildings to make way for the office-warehouse combo–with City Staff Jessica Vaughn noting there is an application on file to demolish multiple single-family homes in order to make way for stormwater drainage and additional parking. WYSER’s building design includes pre-cast concrete, which is common for the area; however, they claim to be adding more color than similar buildings by using sections that have been painted blue. This would be in addition to two variations of gray with some nebulous white accents.\nThe commission immediately questioned WYSER’s design choices–most notably the lack of texture and shadows, in addition to the odd drops in sectioning that corresponded with the site’s topography. Commissioner Klehr asked the developer why the roofline contained step-ups, to which the developer responded by claiming WYSER aims to reduce the height from the blue to gray areas of the exterior in order to make shipping then installing the painted sections easier. Later, when Klehr asked about the lowest elevated corner, the developer stated the tiers were in lieu of sloping to allow for rainwater runoff. The inconsistency somewhat annoyed Commissioner Klehr, with her going so far as to state her opinion that WYSER should be basing their design off of something in the area, such as the neighboring fire station; furthermore, she argued the design looked “sloppy” and “odd, rather than purposeful.”\nCommissioner Asad’s statements echoed a similar sentiment, drawing attention the the “weird steps” in the plan. Asad asserted that a slope of roughly six to twelve inches did not necessitate such drastic designs for steps surrounding sections of the building. Overall, the commission believed WYSER should simply get rid of them. Commissioner Asad further inquired into WYSER’s design choices by questioning the texturing of the building. As it stands now, the developer has chosen to stick with a smooth concrete rather that something more substantial. While Commissioner Asad was pleased with the inclusion of the nebulous white coping, he found the smooth texture lacking in substance. Ultimately, Commissioner Asad believed the pre-cast could be more creative and bring some life to the area and encouraged the developer to be more creative with their design.\nAlder Rummel’s requested a rendering showing the surrounding buildings to establish context as well as giving input on the addition of canopies over the doors on the eastern side of the building. Commissioner Bernau spoke to a similar sentiment, pushing for changes in texture in order to establish more of a base rather than having a tall concrete slabs emerging from the ground.\nWhile Commissioner Graham offered some reprieve by noting WYSER’s plan aligns with the Urban Development District as far as the parking lot proposal, Commissioner Bernau was quick to jump in again and note it is not in an ideal location considering the cross section of the site’s location. Commissioner Bernau additionally urged WYSER to consider vision triangles with regard to the parking area–especially when considering the sidewalk crossing.\nCommissioner Bernau further dug into WYSER’s landscaping plans. For one, the current proposal includes day lilies on the north side of the building in what will be a heavily shaded area. Being a sun-loving pant, these will need to be relocated in the plan. In addition to plant placement, Commissioner Bernau voiced disappointment in the density of the proposed plants. According to the Commissioner, although the shrubs are spread out the amount is fine; however, WYSER should be planting 75% more perennials to establish the parcel. Bernau also noted the omission of plants that will be used to fill the bio retentions, clarifying for the developer these will need to include a specific mix of native plants and cannot be filled with lawn. Lastly, WYSER’s proposal included a dyed brown mulch. Keeping consistent with eco-awareness, Commissioner Bernau advocated for the use of naturally colored wood mulch, rather than something with dyes that could wash out and be absorbed into the land. WYSER did mention they are working with the Forestry Department to better establish the landscape and plants.\nUltimately, the commission voted to have WYSER come back at a later date with a revised design based on their feedback from this evening’s meeting.\n\n\n7 Brew Coffee\nFor their second major item of the night, the Commission reviewed design plans for the new two-story 7 Brew drive-through proposed for 3915 Lien Road in Urban Design District 5, located in District 3 Legistar 86494. This is in a TOD overlay zoning district and so requires a 2-story design. While 7 Brew locations are typically a modular design, the developer drew attention the obstacles they have been facing with regard to the district’s building codes and claimed it compromised the overall design. While the coffee vendor would utilize a system where employees take orders on iPads directly from drive-through customers rather than speakers, the requirements for the second floor canopy has become a challenge. According to Staff Member Vaughn, ordinances require the second floor to provide at least 75% of the amount of space as the ground floor. Due to this, the developer has come up with a design that includes a shipping container, with a blue ribboning utilized to separate the lower section’s masonry look from the upper section’s metal composure. The shipping container would be further supported by three black beams that separate lanes one and two of the drive through and are designed to mount menus onto. Additionally, the container canopy is planned to have warmers to offer some reprieve for employees during the harsh Wisconsin winters–similar to what Madisonians have seen at both the east and west side Chick-fil-A locations and BRT stations.\nAlder Rummel later questioned Staff regarding the drive through, wanting to know why 7 Brew must have such a large upper portion to the coffee shop, versus a smaller upstairs and a parapet over the drive through. Staff reiterated the 75% rule for a second floor to comply with district requirements and ordinances, indicating this is where the idea for the blue ribbon came from in order to help ease the transition from the lower imitation-masonry to the upper shipping container. Alder Rummel voiced her displeasure with the ordinance, with which City Staff Vaughn agreed as it had caused the developers to return to the drawing board several times and start from scratch in order to remain compliant with district requirements.\nAlder Rummel was not the only commissioner unimpressed with the design. At one point, Commissioner Brenau compared it to a construction workshop, telling everyone to “just Google ‘elevated job trailer.’” Even Commissioner Asad stated “the concept is modern, but the application is brutalist.” The developer strongly disagreed, stating it would be considered monolithic as they have worked to establish rhythm in the design. Asad further argued his point before somewhat conceding by saying that this is perhaps a matter of opinion. All in all, Commissioner Asad thought the design was a “cool concept that could really work,” but thought the rendering needed additional review for the application of materials. The development team eagerly attempted to gather more input from the Commissioner, but was met with Asad stating he was “not going to design it right now;” however, he did offer ideas such as a darker base, redesigning the blue ribbon, or doing something different with the black beams which currently blend in and get eaten by the shadows.\nCommissioner Asad further clarified his concern was not necessarily about adding more material, but examining how the materials themselves are being applied within the design. Noting the rendering quality may be impacting his opinion, the Commissioner voiced the need for more texture or visual attachment to bring life to the design with additional details. Commissioner Asad additionally stated just because it is a more modern, modular design, does not mean windows are the best approach to add life to the building. Alder Rummel and Commissioner Klehr agreed, noting the building lacked harmony, with Klehr drawing attention to one of the renderings appearing to include three different window sizes: smaller square windows on the shipping container, narrow rectangular widow on the upper masonry section, and wider rectangular windows on the lower portion. The developer clarified this was an error in the rendering, as there should only be two window size–one rectangular size for the masonry section and one square size for the shipping container’s windows. The developer additionally clarified the windows planned for the masonry sections would be in-set to add depth to the design and noted the masonry sections are planned to be made up of imitation panels rather than actual brick.\nThe question of parking and accessibility was then brought up by multiple Commision members. The City requires the site to provide 3.75 parking spaces, which the developers fully provide by including three regular spaces and one ADA reserved stall. This is in additional to conversations with neighboring properties, who have tentatively agreed to share additional parking to serve as overflow for employees and customers. Commissioner Bernau then asked why the developers did not provide more green space by having the initial passthrough being as one or two lanes that open up to the full three, which paired well with Alder Rummel questioning why to second story was designed to be perpendicular to the lower portion. The developers and City Staff jointly clarified that City Engineering advised on three individual lanes to avoid delivery trucks from blocking customers’ access. As for the perpendicular design, Emergency Vehicles would not fit under the drive through canopy. This prompted the developers to come up with a design that would allow emergency vehicles to gain better, more immediate access to the front doors in case they needed to get inside the building. While the 7 Brew will not be publicly accessible, there is still a need for access in case an employee gets hurt or has an emergency. It also allows better fire truck access in the event they need to respond to a call at the location.\nThis prompted Commissioner Graham to ask for the width of each of the lanes, which the developers provided as being 14.5” for Lane 1, 15” for Lane 2, and 16” for Lane 3. Lane three is intentionally wider to allow room for delivery trucks to maneuver through the curve without interfering with customers or potentially brushing up against the building. Commissioner Graham then redirected the conversation to accessibility by requesting clarification on the retention wall located along the East Washington Avenue side of the building. The developers stated the retention wall is roughly three feet high, and although there is an access ramp, pedestrians will still be directed around the neighboring gas station due to the slope of the site. The developers also noted an existing ditch and swale on the north side of the curb, which is due to the topography. City Staff noted that adding an additional pathway might be difficult due to the limited space, but suggested the possibility of opening the ramp up at an earlier point may aid in accessibility–especially when it comes to wheelchair users–and could help alleviate pressure the current design puts on pedestrians to walk across areas designated for cars.\nCommissioner Bernau also pointed out the wave-type bike rack used in WYSER’s proposal is not on the City’s list of approved styles and instructed the developers to make sure they are using allowable equipment. Bernau, echoed by Commissioner Graham, further advocated an increase in pedestrian amenities. Alder Rummel questioned where the nearest BRT stop is located in relation to the site, with other members mentioning there is a stop just down the block in front of the east side Hyvee. This furthered the Commission’s commitment to pushing for increased pedestrian access, with Alder Rummel going so far as to suggest an outdoor patio that could be used both by pedestrians and as a make-shift break area for employees during the warmer months.\nAfter extensive discussion, the Commission ultimately approved the initial design conditioned on revisions.\n\n\nSecretary’s Report\nIt was noted that the Plan Commission will be the approving body on upcoming changes proposed for demolition permits submitted to the City of Madison. The move stems from the City’s desire to remove administrative tasks from the purview of various Commissions and Committees and instead relocate them to City Staff who are more familiar with the requirements and ordinances associated with applications.\nThe Secretary also noted the March 5th meeting is slated to be another light meeting, with only three items currently on the docket, the first of which is a comprehensive signage review for Baker’s Place. She mentioned that the area is “really starting to take shape” and personally thinks it looks “really good.” The remaining two items will be informational presentations, one for upcoming design plans at the corner of East Washington Avenue and South Franklin Street near their previously discussed Porchlight project, and the other pertaining to a five-unit, multi-family home being proposed for the corner of East Washington Avenue and North Fair Oaks.\nLastly, the Secretary reassured the Commissioners she is working diligently to fill a number of empty seats that remain on the committee with several promising prospects. At this point, the group is running on a skeleton crew, meaning if anyone were to lose connection during the meeting it is highly likely they would lose quorum and need to halt operations. This is problematic, as it impacts timing for not only Urban Planning’s approvals, but applicants’ abilities to move on to other committees’ approvals as well. As if on cue, Alder Rummel was needed elsewhere by the City and Commissione Asad’s presentation was put on hold for yet another week."

    "text": "Meeting Details\n\nDecember 15, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on December 15, 2025, focusing primarily on presentation and discussion of the Southwest and Southeast Area Plan drafts, while also approving several development projects and zoning modifications.\n\nCapital City Trail Setback Reduction\nLegistar 7748027\n\n\n\nSetback Reduction Staff Comment\n\n\nThe Commission approved reducing rear setbacks to 5 feet for properties in mixed-use, employment, and downtown zoning districts near the Capital City Trail. Staff hopes this will allow for greater activation of trail space.\n\n\nBlount and Dayton Street Density Increase\n\n203-215 N Blount Street and 710-712 E Dayton Street\nLegistar 7714603\nThe Commission unanimously approved increasing an already-approved small apartment building from 8 units to 16 units, along with minor changes to siding materials.\n\n\n\nBlount Street Increased by 8 units\n\n\nCommunity Process Concerns: Bob Klebba, a well-known local preservationist and chair of the Tenney-Lapham development committee, complained about the lack of a neighborhood meeting and requested the item be referred until such a meeting could occur. Klebba stated that Alder Mayer blocked an attempt to refer the item to a future Urban Design Commission meeting to allow for neighborhood engagement.\nPlanning Context: The site is located in a TOD overlay, but because it was originally a Planned Development (PD), it doesn’t receive automatic height bonuses and requires modification of that plan. The modification is similar enough to the original proposal that it doesn’t require Common Council approval.\nThe addition of 8 extra units in a similar form to the original development represents core “missing middle” housing - small-scale multifamily that fits neighborhood character.\nThe project had already been approved by the Urban Design Commission with some conditions.\n\n\n\nCommercial Avenue Large-Scale Development\n\n2150 Commercial Avenue - 241 Units\nCSM Legistar 7730051 UDC Approval Legistar 7451268\nThe Commission approved a certified survey map to create one large lot from the current parking lot between Packers Avenue and Oscar Avenue north of Commercial Avenue, to accommodate a 241-unit single building.  Urban Design Concerns: The Urban Design Commission had concerns about the single building’s massing and will require resubmission to UDC.\n\n\n\nCommercial Avenue Large Apartment Rendering\n\n\nApproval Process: This building will not return to Plan Commission because it is a permitted use in the proactively rezoned area, representing an interesting test case for allowing large apartment buildings by right in such areas.\nProperty Owner Concerns: The other owner of property at Oscar Mayer expressed concern about a single building potentially blocking views from Packers Avenue of any future development from their property.\nUDC still needs to grant final approval.\n\n\n\nArea Plan Presentations and Discussion\nThe Commission received presentations on draft Southwest and Southeast Area Plans, scheduled for approval in Spring 2026.\n\nSoutheast Area Plan\nPresentation 15029175\nStaff proposed upzoning several areas and promoting mixed-use corridors, while eliminating opportunities for increased density in certain Low-Medium Residential (LMR) situations.\nHighway 51 Planning: Much of the plan depends on whether WisDOT allows boulevard treatment for US Highway 51, which would enable more pedestrian-friendly development along the corridor. The city plans to create a plan for Highway 51 assuming the current 45 mph limited-access design, but wants to illustrate what a more urban option would look like and be prepared if WisDOT chooses that approach for Highway 51 reconstruction.\n\n\n\nHighway 51 Alternatives\n\n\nMajor Redevelopment Sites: - Old American Family site (Highway 51 at Highway 30) might be converted into a neighborhood - Cottage Grove Road near Walgreens could see further redevelopment\n\n\n\nAmerican Family Site\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Cottage Grove Rd Redevelopment\n\n\nCommunity Feedback\n\n\n\nSoutheast Area Plan Feedback\n\n\nResidential Use Restrictions: Staff indicated they are limiting residential uses in some areas because they don’t believe all locations are appropriate for housing, particularly along Highway 51 or adjacent to industrial spaces. They don’t think mixed-use should be implemented everywhere.\n\n\n\nEliminate Increased Density Option for LMR\n\n\nThis approach, along with the recent Verona Road apartment building debate, highlights conflict between those who believe residential uses could go anywhere versus planners who generally want to use zoning to separate what they consider incompatible uses.\nNew Land Use Category: Staff proposed adding MR1 (Medium Residential 1), a new category between Low-Medium Residential (LMR) and Medium Residential (MR), while also eliminating density increase possibilities in some LMR areas. There was implicit concern that having different land use categories across different area plans could create confusion.\n\n\n\nMR1 Land Use Category\n\n\nEmployment and Industrial Preservation: Staff expressed concern about residential uses crowding out employment and industrial uses in the southeast area, wanting to preserve those land uses in certain plan areas.\n\n\n\nEmployment Preservation\n\n\nAlder Pritchett raised concerns about health impacts for people living near industrial uses or in high-density areas, questioning whether pollution studies could be conducted.\n\n\n\nDensity Corridors\n\n\n\n\nSouthwest Area Plan\nPresentation 15029173\nThe new MR1 land use category features prominently in the Southwest plan to allow more mixed-use development. The plan proposes possible Schroeder Road realignment along with other bike and pedestrian improvements.\nCommunity Feedback:  Comparative Scope: ZENZ Commentary during the meeting characterized the Southwest Area Plan as less dramatic than the Southeast plan, with much more significant changes being proposed for the east side than the west.\nProactive Rezoning for Residential Restriction: Staff proposed proactively rezoning the area near the Beltline and Verona Road from CC-T (Commercial Corridor-Transitional) to CC (Commercial Corridor) to limit residential uses, arguing the area is not appropriate for housing. This continues a trend of staff using area plans to restrict residential uses in areas they believe are unsuitable.\n\n\n\nProactive Rezoning\n\n\nCommission Concerns: Commissioner Wasniewski expressed concern about limiting options by changing those areas near Verona Rd near the beltline to CC zoning.\n\n\n\nVerona Rd and Beltline Rezoning\n\n\nCommissioner Field questioned whether areas west of the commuter bike path (near Home Depot) could be designated for transitional uses instead of current industrial zoning. Staff responded that public comment emphasized retaining employment uses.\nCommissioner Guequierre raised concerns about potential disruption from possible additional Beltline lanes following the WisDOT Beltline study, worried about losing employment areas along the corridor.\nThe area plan discussions revealed ongoing tensions between housing advocates seeking residential flexibility and planners prioritizing use separation and employment land preservation, with notably different approaches proposed for east versus west side development.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nMeeting Agenda: Madison Plan Commission\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on December 1, 2025, advancing significant “Housing Forward” reforms to Transit-Oriented Development districts, approving the controversial no-parking downtown apartment building after months of delay, and greenlight several major housing projects.\n\nTransit-Oriented Development Overlay Reforms\nLegistar 7710968\n\n\n\nTOD 3-4 Units by Right\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved major changes to the TOD overlay district, advancing “Housing Forward” initiatives while rejecting an attempt to exclude a historic neighborhood from fourplex development.\n\n\n\nTOD Drive-through Restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\nTOD Auto Uses Restrictions\n\n\nKey Changes Approved: - Allow fourplex construction by right - Ban standalone parking lots (private only; public lots like park-and-ride remain allowed) - Ban standalone car washes - Ban car sales facilities - Additional restrictions on drive-throughs - Allow auto rentals (added by amendment)\nUniversity Hill Farms Controversy: The only public speaker argued that allowing four units by right in University Hill Farms would harm the historic district. Alder Tishler proposed an amendment requiring conditional use review specifically for University Hill Farms, describing it as “one of the last of the planned communities in America…after 1948” and praising how it was “designed right.”\n\n\n\nUniversity Hill Farms TOD Map\n\n\nTishler emphasized that University Hill Farms is nationally registered (though not a local historic district) and suggested its intactness is why the TOD runs through it. He noted the area already includes duplexes and he considers ADUs acceptable, but worried that allowing too much change might cause loss of historic designation. He suggested the curve of streets adds fragments of the neighborhood into the TOD and claimed it’s “the largest ‘residential’ area where the TOD runs through.”\nCommission Response: Staff reminded the Commission that University Hill Farms is nationally registered but not a local historic district. When TOD overlay was originally implemented, there was a push to exclude historic districts that failed. Heather Bailey noted that changes of use don’t impact national historic designation or tax credits.\nCommissioner Heck observed that all historic districts are unique and others already exist in the TOD. He argued that having a few 3-4 unit parcels improves ability for people to age in place. Commissioner Wasniewski noted he has met with aging people in Hill Farms worried about finding housing to stay in the neighborhood as they age.\nCommissioner Wasniewski asked whether there had been efforts to make Hill Farms a local historic district. Staff indicated no application has been submitted, though it has been suggested in the past to protect historic character, but noted it would not prevent changes in use or development.\nThe Transportation and Housing Policy Committee had recommended passage of the TOD changes along with separation of auto rental from sales, but did not recommend excluding Hill Farms.\nTishler’s amendment failed, and the reforms passed unanimously.\nAdditional Details: The ban on standalone parking lots applies only to private facilities and wouldn’t prohibit accessory parking for businesses. There are grandfathering provisions for existing uses that can be transferred, though non-city parking like UW-Madison or state facilities count as private parking.\n\n\nProactive TOD Rezonings\nThe Commission unanimously approved several proactive rezonings to align properties with TOD overlay requirements:\nWest Side: - University & Whitney\n\n\n\nUniversity & Whitney Rezoning\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity & Whitney\n\n\n\nMineral Point & Gammon\n\n\n\n\nMineral Point & Gammon Rezoning\n\n\n\n\n\nMineral Point & Gammon\n\n\nEast Side: - Lien Road (North of Target)\n\n\n\nLien Road Rezoning\n\n\n\nEast Washington & Lexington\n\n\n\n\nEast Washington & Lexington Rezoning\n\n\n\n\nCottage Court Development Standards\nLegistar 7710959\n\n\n\nCottage Court Example 1\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved new zoning allowing cottage courts as a permitted use, with amendments to increase flexibility.\n\n\n\nCottage Court Example 2\n\n\nBase Proposal: - Maximum 8 units per development - Maximum 1,000 square feet per unit - Minimum lot size requirements - Minimum 6 feet between homes - Required courtyard of at least 20 feet by 20 feet (can include trees but not parking, driveways, or buildings)\nStakeholder Input: Public speakers including developers and advocates argued the restriction of 8 units and 1 acre minimum is too limiting.\nAmendments Approved: 1. Allow two-unit buildings as well as single-family homes in cottage courts (still maximum 8 units total) - passed unanimously 2. Reduce required rear setback to 8 feet for cottage courts in all zoning districts - passed 6-2 (Heck and McCahill voting against)\n \nDesign Discussion: Staff explained they want to maintain consistency of setbacks in zoning districts generally, though setbacks within the cottage court have more flexibility as they might be distinct lots.\n\n\n\nCottage Court Reduced Setback\n\n\nCommissioner Solheim asked how they determined size and unit limits. Staff indicated they envisioned a “missing middle” solution around 1/2 acre or larger and around 8 units to have desired amenities while staying in the missing middle category.\nAlternative Development Paths: Alder Ochowicz asked whether cottage courts could be built on two half-acre lots for 18 units. Staff confirmed this was possible through “residential building complex” provisions meant for larger complexes, or through subdivision, though new state law requirements apply to larger sites.\nStaff emphasized the main benefit is cottage courts will be allowed by right, while developers can still pursue residential building complexes or Planned Development routes requiring conditional use and other approvals.\nSetback Debate: Commissioner Solheim initially moved to pass the cottage court changes with the two-unit amendment but without the rear setback reduction.\nAlder Ochowicz argued that without the rear setback change, it would be challenging for developers to build cottage courts. He believed smaller rear setbacks would improve central common space without altering neighbors’ experience, noting other cities have smaller setbacks.\nCommissioner Heck supported the motion without rear setback changes but acknowledged the city needs a broader discussion about setbacks. Commissioner Wasniewski moved to include 8-foot rear setbacks, arguing against creating barriers for missing middle developments.\nAlder Tishler questioned what a cottage court would look like on a lake and whether the lake would be considered the front.\nCommissioner Solheim was convinced by arguments and voted against her own original motion, supporting the setback reduction.\n\n\nDowntown No-Parking Apartment Building Approved\n\n139 W Wilson Street - 320 Units\nLegistar 7506063\nAfter approximately nine months in approval limbo, the Commission approved the controversial 16-story, 320-unit microapartment building with no parking by a 6-2 vote (Alder Glenn and Commissioner Heck voting against). The project does not require Common Council approval.\nDeveloper Modifications: - Management office relocated to first floor - Relocated some bike parking to address concerns about bikes entering through the front door - Reduced trash collection to twice weekly\n\n\n\n139 W Wilson New First-floor Plan\n\n\nBassett Neighborhood Opposition: The Bassett neighborhood remained dissatisfied, arguing: - Delivery vehicles cannot turn around in the drive area - claimed even smaller Amazon trucks cannot maneuver as modeled - The driveway cannot function unless multiple vehicles are never present simultaneously - Only solution is a staff person watching the drive area all day - Manager and maintenance staff cannot adequately monitor from the first floor office - Congestion will spill into public right-of-way and block the Wilson Street cycle track - The building contains too many people for the available space\n\n\n\n139 W Wilson Street Vehicle Backup Plan\n\n\nManagement and Operations: Commissioners Solheim and Heck questioned how building maintenance, cleaning staff, and resident cleaning services would be handled. The developer indicated they would have to park off-site or be dropped off, with building management enforcing a zero-tolerance policy.\nGarbage and recycling logistics were discussed, with potential need for more frequent recycling pickup since it cannot be compacted.\nCommissioner Solheim suggested a glass wall on one side of the manager’s office for line-of-sight to the cycle track. Developers expressed openness to this.\nInfrastructure and Monitoring: Commissioner Heck felt the management plan was “thin” and questioned whether it should include more detail about complaint handling. Staff indicated revised conditions already request further details, particularly regarding cycle track intrusions.\nCommissioner Guequierre asked whether staff verified delivery vehicle turning radius feasibility. Staff confirmed it’s a tight turn but workable. Commissioner Solheim suggested adding bollards at the curve to prevent trucks from going over the curb by the cycle track, though such improvements in the right-of-way might not be within Plan Commission’s authority to require as conditions.\nCommissioner Heck questioned whether a deposit could be required for future traffic improvements. Staff believed existing Traffic and Engineering conditions could cover site-specific problems that might develop.\nCommission Votes: Commissioner Guequierre moved to approve with an added condition requiring the manager’s office to have a clear view of the cycle path. He supported the “experiment of an auto-free apartment downtown” and believed the conditions enable this.\nCommissioner Heck stated he’s not concerned about buildings without parking generally, but wasn’t convinced this building will work operationally. He predicted it will be a “parking/loading disaster” and felt the developer didn’t respond appropriately to the previous meeting’s requests, believing it needs “almost a 24/7 manager.”\nAlder Verveer agreed with Heck, arguing conditional use standards 3 and 5 cannot be met. He didn’t believe the management plan addresses concerns adequately, though noting the neighborhood supports increased density and lack of parking. He concluded the building cannot be serviced without disruption.\n\n\n\nStudent Housing Development\n\n450 W Gilman Street - 118 Units\nThe Commission unanimously approved demolition, rezoning, conditional use, and certified survey map for a 16-story, 118-unit student-focused apartment complex at 450 W Gilman Street, with 44 beds of affordable student housing (enabled by 4 extra stories through the affordable housing bonus). The project includes a rooftop pool (not an infinity pool, as it has a walkway around it). Rezoning and CSM still require Common Council approval.\n\n\n\n450 W Gilman Street Rendering\n\n\nDemolition Controversy: Legistar 7703831\nThe project requires demolishing a building from 1890 that received a B grade from the Landmarks Commission, indicating some historic value. The building formerly served as the university hotel and currently contains apartments.\n\n\n\n450 W Gilman Street Existing Building\n\n\nA public speaker discussed the building’s history, noting it’s “just as remarkable as a lot of landmarks” and requesting documentary record of the structure.\nStaff initially found the building had no historic value, but Landmarks Commission determined it had some value.\nNeighbor Concerns: The owner of the adjacent Grimm building argued the existing building doesn’t fit the area. She owns a nearby building and worried the new construction will block sunlight and cause mold to develop. She also suggested Landmarks should have investigated the history of the Port Bella, which will also be demolished, mentioning possible mafia involvement.\nCommissioner Heck asked about one speaker’s concern that people might throw bottles from the roof. The developer explained minimum balconies will prevent throwing objects, and the roof will be managed when open. They noted they routinely monitor impacts on adjacent foundations, including older ones.\nCommissioner Heck wondered whether the developer could help Grimm document their foundation’s current state. Staff recommended against this as a private matter between parties that the city shouldn’t involve itself in.\nLegistar Links: - Rezoning 7710956 - Conditional Use 7698222\n\n\n\nWhitney Way Apartment Conversion\n\n501 N Whitney Way - 42 Units\nLegistar 7698589\n\n\n\n501 N Whitney Way Rendering\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved a conditional use to demolish a 15-unit building to build a 42 unit building at 501 N Whitney Way in the Traditional Shopping Street and TOD district. The project requests one additional story beyond what’s normally allowed. Staff supported the height with some adjustments to soften massiveness, including facade changes on the bottom right side.\nThe project eliminates surface parking.\nNeighbor Concerns: One neighbor expressed concern about bright lighting at the front door near their bedroom windows and worried rents in the new building would be more expensive than the existing affordable older building.\nThe developer committed to only external lights for safety that will be downcast, with intent not to bother neighbors.\nZoning and CSM approval still require Common Council action.\n\n\n\nFuture Meetings\nThe December 15 Plan Commission meeting will feature staff discussion of the Southwest and Southeast Area Plans. Many developments scheduled for that meeting will be delayed to future dates.\nThe meeting demonstrated continued advancement of housing-friendly policies while highlighting persistent tensions between density goals and operational concerns, particularly around car-free developments in downtown areas.\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nMeeting Agenda: Madison Plan Commission\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on November 17, 2025, addressing a mix of routine approvals including an adult day care conversion, historic water utility infrastructure, and additional plat approvals for the Starkweather development.\n\nDeferred Item\n\n139 W Wilson Street Microapartment Building\nThe controversial 320-unit, no-parking apartment building at 139 W Wilson Street was referred to December at the developer’s request, postponing continued discussion of loading zone and management concerns.\n\n\n\nAdult Day Care Conversion\n\n4718 Hammersley Road\nLegistar 7696414\nThe Commission unanimously approved a conditional use to convert a commercial building to an adult day care center serving approximately 30 people at 4718 Hammersley Road.\n\n\n\n4718 Hammersley Rd\n\n\nPublic Concerns: The first public speaker expressed worry about people “wandering into” his yard. A second speaker questioned whether the facility was related to a nearby site that supposedly has many cars parked without license plates - though that other facility may not exist and isn’t owned by this operator.\nPublic comment also requested addition of a private sidewalk to Starlight Drive, but staff noted the city doesn’t typically recommend private sidewalks to cul-de-sacs without existing sidewalks. Any traffic through the property will be cut off.\nConditions of Approval: One condition imposed by staff requires addition of a stop sign off the property.\n\n\n\nHistoric Water Utility Well Reconstruction\n\nWell 12 at 801 S Whitney Way\nLegistar 7684193\n\n\n\nWell 12\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved demolition of Well 12, along with conditional use and zoning changes for a new well building at 801 S Whitney Way.\nHistoric Significance: The Landmarks Commission found the well has historic value because it was built in the early 20th century Prairie well style and speaks to the history of the water utility. While the well was actually built in 1957, it follows the style of earlier wells.\n\n\n\nWell 12 Design Elements\n\n\nUtility Needs: The water utility seeks to rebuild the facility to enable greater use of its high-quality water on the west side and address existing deficiencies. The current well is becoming very weathered.\nPreservation Plans: The water utility committed to “honor” the historic properties by building a similar well and using some existing limestone. They will preserve the Well 12 sign and some dress block, though reclaiming more stone or additional preservation would be too expensive.\nAlder Engagement: Alder Tishler announced plans for a town hall in the coming days to discuss the project and questioned how much stone would be preserved, particularly advocating for preservation of the Well 12 sign.\n\n\n\nStarkweather Plat Expansion\n\nAdditional Parcels Between Residential and Amazon\nLegistar 7710955\n\n\n\nStarkweather Plat Addition\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously recommended approval of rezoning and platting for additional parcels of the Starkweather Plat (also known as Voit Farm) for medium residential and commercial use. The parcels are located between already-platted residential areas to the west and Amazon facilities to the east.\nInfrastructure: An outlot to the north is designated for stormwater management.\n\n\n\nStarkweather Plat Street Network\n\n\nPublic Concerns: One public comment raised concerns about the lack of sidewalk on the north side of Milwaukee Street, though the developer indicated land would be dedicated for sidewalks. The commenter also expressed worry about Amazon-related traffic near residential areas.\n\n\n\nStarkweather Plat Zoning Map\n\n\nApproval: Both the certified survey map and rezoning for this latest portion of the Starkweather development received unanimous recommendation for approval.\nThe meeting demonstrated continued progress on major east side developments while addressing community concerns about infrastructure and neighborhood impacts, with particular attention to balancing historic preservation with functional utility needs.\n\n\n\n\nNovember 3, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on November 3, 2025, with extended debate over a controversial 320-unit microapartment building downtown that raised significant concerns about loading zone congestion and management, ultimately resulting in a referral for additional planning.\n\nStreet Name Change Advisory\n\nRuskin Street to Huxley Street\nLegistar 7710958\n\n\n\nRuskin to Huxley\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously recommended changing the name of the southern portion of Ruskin Street to Huxley Street to accommodate a new through connection near the Hartmeyer development. The recommendation is advisory to the Board of Public Works, which had already approved the change.\nBackground: A new portion of Huxley Street is being built soon, with curbs already in place. The change will result in some address modifications for affected properties.\nBusiness Opposition: Several businesses on Ruskin Street and others in the neighborhood objected to both the road connection and the address change due to associated costs. Opponents noted that Ruskin Street is already separated to the north. Commissioner Matthews expressed concern about the costs to businesses and indicated she would raise the issue at Common Council.\nOne particularly impacted business owner had been upset about the Huxley connection when a nearby apartment complex was proposed, as it would require moving numerous cars stored in the public right-of-way.\nPlanning Rationale: Staff clarified that keeping the street named Ruskin would create significant confusion, as there would be a street name change with no intersection or other feature to designate the change. Alder Field noted that a similar pattern occurs in his neighborhood and is problematic, supporting the name change as necessary.\n\n\n\nControversial Downtown Microapartment Development Referred\n\n139 W Wilson Street High-Rise\nLegistar 7506063\n\n\n\n139 W Wilson St\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously voted to refer consideration of a 16-story, 320-unit microapartment building at 139 W Wilson Street to a future meeting, requesting a comprehensive management plan addressing loading zone congestion concerns.\n\n\n\nMicrounit Example\n\n\nStaff Concerns: Staff expressed concern that the building may be too dense for the narrow lot and, with no parking provided, could generate excessive loading and pickup activity. The project had previously been stalled due to similar concerns about loading space and parking. Staff indicated that conditions for approval could potentially be met but significant concerns remained.\n\n\n\nStaff Report\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff Report\n\n\nProject Details: The development represents a model urbanist approach to affordable market-rate housing: small units, 16 stories, and no parking to maximize housing density while keeping prices down. The building includes a top-floor management office along with co-working space and a clubhouse. The developer is not receiving any public subsidy.\n\n\n\nSite Profile\n\n\nCommunity Opposition: A representative from a nearby apartment building objected, arguing the project needs more parking. The neighborhood association also objected, citing concerns about excessive traffic and activity for such a small lot, echoing staff concerns.\nDeveloper’s Response: The developer provided scenarios for service and garbage vehicle access and planned for staggered move-ins. They proposed 9 or 14-month leases so that after initial move-ins (which they acknowledged would be busier than normal), there would be less ongoing traffic.\n\n\n\nLoading Dock Plan\n\n\nThe developer pushed back against assumptions that residents without parking would necessarily order more food delivery, and noted available off-site parking in the Dane County garage and nearby apartment buildings.\nLoading and Management Issues: Extended discussion focused on the loading dock and cycle track, with concerns about monitoring and congestion:\nCommissioner Solheim questioned whether the 16th-floor management office could effectively monitor ground-level loading activity. The developer noted cameras would be installed and suggested adding an evening management shift if problems arose.\n\n\n\nDelivery and Drop-off Plan\n\n\nCommissioner Heck expressed concern about monitoring the loading dock and cycle track from the 16th floor only during daytime hours, preferring on-site personnel. He referenced management plans typically required for student housing.\nAlder Glenn worried about initial move-in traffic and asked about off-site parking options. She was particularly concerned that residents would park on nearby streets.\nAlder Guequierre estimated that if 10% of residents received food/package delivery or used rideshare on any given day, the loading dock might become overcrowded. Traffic staff worried people wouldn’t use the loading area if it wasn’t visible.\nDesign Modification Suggestions: Commissioner Solheim proposed moving bike parking to higher floors or relocating mechanicals to create more loading dock space. The developer responded this would reduce units and encroach on pedestrian-only paths. She also suggested moving the management office to the first floor, though the developer noted managers would likely move throughout the building regardless of office location.\n\n\n\nStreet View\n\n\nAlder Glenn questioned whether the building should have more elevators. Staff noted most comparable buildings have three elevators, though one has two, and suggested the building might be underserved - though this would be a building code issue.\nGarbage and Bike Access: Staff confirmed that while the garbage pickup plan requiring trucks to back into the site is not preferred, it’s standard for downtown developments. Commissioner Heck worried about bike entry, though staff noted a side entrance would prevent all bikes from using one door. Heck remained concerned about bikes competing with garbage trucks.\nAlder Verveer’s Position: Alder Verveer stated he was struggling with the application, believing there is no perfect solution for the impacts. The application had been referred from the Plan Commission in 2024 after the Urban Design Commission recommended denial. He noted cycle track blockage has been a problem that this development would likely worsen.\nVerveer acknowledged improvements in the application but wanted additional conditions related to blocking public right-of-way, including: a resident manager, moving the office to the first floor and reconfiguring that space, and more detailed plans for waste removal and move-in/out procedures.\nVerveer requested either referral with a public management plan in Legistar, or if approved that night, making the management plan a minor alteration requiring his involvement as the local alder and public input.\nReferral Motion: Commissioner Solheim moved to refer so the developer could produce a management plan describing pedestrian, car, delivery, and garbage access, while recommending first-floor office space.\nCommissioner Heck warned the developer he wouldn’t hesitate to vote against the proposal if requested conditions weren’t met.\nAlder Figueroa Cole urged the Commission to focus on the loading zone at the next meeting rather than expanding into other issues, calling it “a good project that needs a little bit of adjustment in the zoning area.”\nBroader Context: Commentary during the meeting noted this proceeding exemplified why housing construction is expensive even in places claiming to want more housing. Staff also clarified that while these units might be cheaper than other new units due to size and features, they won’t be as affordable as subsidized housing.\n\n\n\nWest Dayton Street Infill Development\nLegistar 7659093\nThe Commission unanimously approved a conditional use permit for two 2-unit buildings to be constructed in the backyard of two 3-unit buildings at 511 W Dayton Street.\n\n\n\n511 W Dayton St\n\n\nThe Urban Design Commission had requested cladding changes, an additional side window, and a window in the bike parking area, while also wanting final UDC approval. The developer objected to adding a window in the bike area.\nThe Plan Commission removed the requirement for the bike area window and the requirement for a second UDC approval before granting unanimous approval.\nThe meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between housing production goals and managing neighborhood impacts, with particular focus on how dense, car-free urban housing can be successfully integrated into downtown areas.\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on October 20, 2025, approving several significant housing developments on Madison’s east side, including affordable senior housing and the return of a controversial subdivision proposal.\n\nMajor Housing Approvals\n\nEast Washington and Fair Oaks Mixed-Use Development\nLegistar 88439961\n\n\n\nEast Washington and Fair Oaks\n\n\nThe Commission approved on the consent agenda a 171-unit apartment building at East Washington Avenue and Fair Oaks Avenue.\n\n\nEast Washington Affordable Senior Housing\nLegistar 88642817\n\n\n\n3222 E Washington Ave\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved a five-story, 91-unit affordable senior apartment building at 3222 E Washington Avenue that will include offices for social services. The project is located very near the 171-unit building approved earlier in the same meeting.\nDesign Features: Though not required by ordinance, the building steps down to two stories along the neighborhood to the west. The site has dramatic elevation changes, and the city is requiring a traffic study to understand potential negative impacts on the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\n\nCourtyard\n\n\nThe building features a U-shaped design with a courtyard and a split parking garage. Primary parking and bike entrances are located on East Washington Avenue.\n\n\n\nParking Garage\n\n\nLutheran Social Services will occupy the office space and maintain staffing during daytime hours.\nBike Parking Condition: Commissioner Heck questioned whether bike parking could be relocated from the East Washington entrance to the Ridgeway entrance, arguing it would be safer for cyclists to use Ridgeway. He added a condition of approval requiring the developer to explore moving the bike parking, which passed unanimously with the project.\n\n\n\nLeo Living Subdivision Returns\nLegistar 88642267\nThe “Leo Living” subdivision on the far east side returned to the Commission after being previously rejected. Staff had initially determined that the plan did not adequately account for areas needed exclusively for stormwater management.\n\n\n\nLeo Living Preliminary Plat\n\n\nRevised Plan: The southwest portion of the property will now remain undeveloped, with part of it dedicated as parkland. Staff informed the Commission that before final plat approval, the developer must make additional refinements including more outlots for park space, stormwater management, and road improvements.\n\n\n\nSingle-family Lots\n\n\nThe Commission considered the zoning changes and preliminary plat for recommendation to Common Council, with one condition of approval being submission of an amended preliminary plat.\nLegal Considerations: Staff noted that approval is recommended partly because the preliminary plat is generally consistent with the comprehensive plan, which under state law requires the city to approve it, though conditions can be imposed.\nThe Leo Living subdivision preliminary plat and zoning changes were approved unanimously.\n\n\nNorth Orchard Street Extension\nA 48-unit apartment building at 120 N Orchard Street was placed on file. The developers already have a conditional use approval for the site that is nearing expiration. Under recent changes allowing conditional use permits to be extended up to 5 years after approval, the developers will now extend that existing approval rather than seeking new approval.\n\n\n\nOctober 6, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on October 6, 2025, approving several significant housing developments and advancing major “Housing Forward” zoning reforms proposed by the Mayor, while also controversially approving a drive-through coffee shop in a Transit-Oriented Development district.\n\nMajor Housing Approvals\n\nFrances Street High-Rise Student Housing\nLegistar 89452\nThe Commission approved a 16-story, 387-unit student apartment building at 305 N Frances Street. While the zone typically allows a maximum of 12 stories, the developer utilized a program that permits additional stories in exchange for building affordable units, with 10% of units receiving a 40% discount.\n\n\n\n305 N Frances St\n\n\nNotably, the building still meets height restrictions in the area because residential buildings tend to have lower per-story heights than commercial buildings, and the ordinances assume standard commercial story heights.\n\n\n\nCurrent Saxony Building\n\n\nThe project replaces the older Saxony building, which contains 230 units that are generally more affordable. Staff was uncertain whether there would be a net loss in total affordable beds, as the new building includes some very large units.\nThe Commission passed the conditional use and recommended certified survey map approval, with Commissioner Bhasin voting against the conditional use.\n\n\nRaemisch Farm Final Plat\nLegistar 89766\n\n\n\nRaemisch Farm Final Plat\n\n\nThe Commission approved the final plat for the eastern portion of Raemisch Farm, which will contain the multifamily and commercial components. The developer indicated the single-family portion will be finalized in winter.\n\n\n\nEntire Preliminary Plat\n\n\nThe preliminary plat was originally approved in 2022 but required resolution of airport building height restrictions. The 2022 approval was controversial, with the developer required to preserve woods adjacent to a school to the south and accept restrictions on building in the eastern portion for several years due to F-35 concerns.\n\n\n\nControversial Drive-Through Coffee Shop Approval\nLegistar 89479\nIn a narrow 5-2 vote, the Commission approved a two-lane drive-through coffee shop in a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) district at 53 West Towne Mall. This is similar to a similar project on Lien Rd that had a difficult review process, first going to the Urban Design Commission in February where its shipping container design was criticized. This design has been altered slightly as well but retained the same basic concept.\n\n\n\n53 West Towne Mall\n\n\nDesign Concerns: The building only includes a second story because it’s required by zoning, with the applicant using it solely for mechanicals and storage. One public speaker questioned whether the developer was a registered company in Wisconsin, while Commissioner Guequierre wondered if there were too many coffee shops in the area.\n\n\n\nSite Layout\n\n\nTOD Standards Debate: Commissioner McCahill questioned how the project meets TOD requirements, such as no parking between the building and frontage street. Staff indicated all requirements were met, noting the presence of a pedestrian window and park bench.\nAlder Field stated the standards were technically met so he would vote for it, but didn’t believe it truly meets the city’s vision for the area, suggesting potential ordinance tweaks.\nCommissioner McCahill voted against, arguing the designated “main entrance” wasn’t truly an entrance. Commissioner Wasniewski also opposed, saying the project is inconsistent with city plans for the area, is entirely auto-oriented, and doesn’t allow customers to go inside.\nSystemic Issues: Despite numerous complaints throughout the year from Plan Commission alders about auto-oriented developments in TODs, no substantial ordinance changes have been proposed to prevent such developments.\n\n\nHousing Forward Zoning Reforms\nThe Commission advanced three major zoning text amendments proposed by the Mayor to facilitate housing development, with particular controversy around exemptions for an exclusive neighborhood.\n\nMinimum Lot Size Reductions\nLegistar 89916\nThe first proposal reduces minimum lot depth, width, and setback requirements in low-density residential areas to allow more divisions of very large lots. Staff indicated approximately 6,300 properties could be impacted by the changes, which could also affect the form of new developments.\n\n\n\nMinimum Setbacks\n\n\nHighlands Neighborhood Opposition: Residents from The Highlands neighborhood requested their special TR-R zone be excluded from the minimum lot area changes, arguing their zones have a special large-lot character and many properties recently signed 40-year private covenants restricting changes.\nStaff responded that the changes are modest and maintain differences between zones, including large lot sizes in TR-R. Staff expressed intent to align special zones like TR-R and Planned Development with other city standards.\nCommission Debate: Alder Guequierre, who represents the district, moved to eliminate TR-R from the setback changes, with Commissioner Heck seconding. Guequierre argued that lot shapes in the Highlands don’t lend themselves to splitting and the neighborhood has “unique historical value.”\n\n\n\nLot Splits\n\n\nCommissioner Wasniewski opposed the exemption, arguing no neighborhood should be exempt from change and that restrictions would reduce property rights. Alder Glenn also opposed, noting the city has grown by 100,000 people. Heck, despite seconding, said restricting the neighborhood from changes is “cringe.”\nGuequierre was the only commissioner to vote for the amendment, which failed. The main motion including TR-R passed unanimously and was recommended to Common Council.\n\n\nHeight Transition Changes\nLegistar 89917\n \nThe second proposal modifies stepdown requirements to allow buildings to reach the maximum height allowed in adjacent districts before stepdown is applied. Currently, stepdown must begin below the maximum height allowed in adjacent districts.\nThe Commission unanimously recommended approval.\n\n\nDuplex ADU Allowances\nLegistar 89918\nThe third proposal allows duplex accessory dwelling units (ADUs) without counting their square footage toward the property’s accessory structure maximum.\n\n\n\nADU Zoning Change\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously recommended approval.\n\n\n\nConditional Use Process Improvements\nLegistar 90056\nThe Commission unanimously recommended approval of minor changes to streamline the conditional use process, extending conditional use approval validity from 2 years to 3 years along with other developer-friendly modifications.\n\n\nFuture Planning Initiatives\nPlanning Director Meagan Tuttle announced that the Mayor intends to soon introduce changes to the TOD overlay to facilitate construction of “missing middle” (small-scale multifamily) housing.\n\n\nNew Sherman Middle School\nOn the consent agenda, the Commission approved conditional use approvals for replacement facilities for Sherman Middle School and Shabazz City High School.\nLegistar 89232\n\n\n\nProposed Sherman/Shabazz\n\n\nThe meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between neighborhood preservation and citywide housing needs, with the Commission ultimately rejecting attempts to exempt wealthy neighborhoods from modest zoning reforms while approving auto-oriented development that conflicts with stated TOD goals.\n\n\n\nSeptember 15, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nConsent Agenda item passed: - Request for conditional use in the Parks and Recreation (PR) District for an outdoor eating area for a food and beverage establishment open after 9:00 p.m., and conditional use for amplified sound for an outdoor eating area at 5501 Schroeder Road in District 20 Legistar 89235.\nReferred to October 6th Meeting to allow for review by the Urban Design Commission: - Request for conditional use in the Traditional Residential-Consistent 4 (TR-C4) District for a school, public or private, and for a building exceeding 10,000 square feet to allow construction of a new public school building to replace Sherman Middle School and Shabazz City High School at 1601 N Sherman Avenue/1610 Ruskin Street in District 12 Legistar 89232.\n\n2025-2030 Park and Open Space Plan\nLegistar 89620: Adopting the 2025-2030 Park and Open Space Plan as a Supplement to the City of Madison Comprehensive Plan (Citywide)\nLisa Laschinger, interim parks superintendent, presented the comprehensive plan highlighting Madison’s status as the fastest-growing city in Wisconsin’s fastest-growing county. The plan emphasizes the need for parks to meet the needs of aging generations by offering more community spaces.\nLaschinger reviewed the Trust for Public Land survey, which examined state, county, city, and UW resources in comparison to green space offered through the parks system. Community engagement efforts were conducted in both English and Spanish to inform the proposal development. The community agreed that parks are integral to overall wellbeing in Madison, supporting the need for more skate parks, walking trails, bike paths, and dog runs.\nPark use has returned to pre-pandemic levels for most activities and surpassed prior use rates in remaining areas. The committee recognized both the housing crisis and the need for park spaces around infill developments throughout Madison. Despite huge need and reliance on parks, Wisconsin invests less funding in these areas than neighboring states.\nMadison Parks relies heavily on volunteers, who contributed almost $1.7 million through their time, effort, and donations in the previous fiscal year. The strategies outlined in the plan build off previously stated goals and are already being partially met through previous proposals.\nNicholas Davies spoke in opposition, concerned about bike parking. He observed over 15 cyclists at Monona Park over the weekend with nowhere to lock their bikes. Davies noted there’s a budget line item for vehicle parking but nothing specific for bike racks, despite Madison being a bike-friendly city. He urged the Plan Commission to consider minimum bike parking requirements for parks.\nCommissioner Heck asked Laschinger to respond to Davies’s statement. Laschinger acknowledged that Davies was correct regarding zoning requirements for parks and recreation spaces. She explained that Madison Parks does consider cyclists; however, much less funding is needed for bike racks than parking spaces. Bike parking is currently included in the “furnishings” budget line but could be specifically added under “amenities” if necessary for approval.\nCity Staff Vaughn noted that comments regarding bicycle parking were forwarded to the zoning board for consideration.\nAlder Guequierre drew attention to the East Towne and West Towne areas, which are being heavily developed but appear to lack green space. Laschinger confirmed these are two larger target areas Madison Parks hopes to address, recognizing the need for larger spaces given population growth and new residences.\nCommissioner Wasniewski asked how the plans address inclusivity with older populations. Laschinger said this will be a focal point in the next five years, exploring amenities such as adult exercise features, walking paths, and pickleball.\nCommissioner Solheim moved for an amendment to add bike parking to the budget, which was included in the item, ultimately leading to approval.\n\n\nBlack Hawk Middle School and Gompers Elementary School - 1402 Wyoming Way\nLegistar 89234: Consideration of conditional use in the Suburban Residential-Consistent 1 (SR-C1) District for a school and for a building exceeding 10,000 square feet to allow construction of a new public school building to replace the existing school at 1402 Wyoming Way in District 18.\nCity Planner Ernest presented the project. Construction of the new school would begin in early 2026, with the existing building remaining until demolition in late 2027. The proposed building will be two levels and approximately 90,000 square feet. The new building will be more central to the site compared to the current building’s street-adjacent location. Additional access points will reduce traffic at the Comanche/Wyoming Way intersection.\nMatt Hasse, part of the design team working with MMSD, reviewed traffic and pedestrian safety plans. The design aims to pull current traffic congestion internally to the site rather than continuing to jam up Comanche/Wyoming Way, offering relief to commuting residents and additional safety for students and staff.\nSusan Bowersox for the design team reviewed floor plans, elevations, renderings, and building perspectives. The new building will be built into the hillside due to the site’s grading and topography.\nNicholas Davies spoke again, criticizing parent drop-off loops as having a poor track record. Davies argued this type of “child drive-through” creates a feedback loop that “induces demand and creates rather than alleviates congestion” as parents arrive earlier to get spots close to the building. He suggested closing off through traffic or making the area traffic-free to avoid bottleneck situations.\nAlder Glenn asked for clarification on the loops and whether there would be designated spaces for parent drop-offs versus bus areas. Hasse explained three loops would break up congestion: Wheeler Road access for Gompers Elementary parents, the Monica Lane loop for Blackhawk, and the southern loop for buses. Glenn questioned whether straight-through options or making Wyoming Way a no-traffic zone during school hours might be better solutions.\nHasse assured the Commission they consulted with City Traffic Engineering early in the project. Due to site grading, there was more concern over pedestrian safety with hills in a straight-through design than with separating drop-off points into three loops. City Traffic Engineering preferred this option for alleviating traffic.\nCommissioner Solheim questioned the grading, noting the renderings made the field appear flat. Hasse clarified the grading issue was with Wheeler Road—while the building site itself is flat, the road is not.\nCommissioner Wasniewski asked about traffic projections. Hasse said they could accurately project bus volume, but vehicle traffic varies daily depending on weather, parent availability, and carpool fluctuation.\nAlder Glenn asked about bike racks. Hasse confirmed there would be ample bike parking and connecting paths for cyclists and pedestrians to accommodate students, staff, and parents.\nAfter extensive discussion about traffic and safety concerns, and despite Commissioner Wasniewski’s disapproval, the item was approved.\n\n\n302 E Washington Avenue Development\nLegistar 89434, Legistar 89375, Legistar 89273, Legistar 88957: Demolition permit, zoning change, conditional use for additional building height, and Certified Survey Map for an 11-story, 76-unit mixed-use building at 302-308 E Washington Avenue/15-27 N Butler Street in District 2.\nCity Planner Lisa Ernest noted this was the first demolition application since the code was amended earlier this year. The Landmarks Commission found historical value in the building but not substantial enough to prevent approval.\nSeveral development team members presented design plans, building height specifications, and how they were utilizing zoning transitions affordable housing to add additional stories to sections of the building.\nLynn Bjorkman spoke in opposition, arguing the historical value of the building was not being given proper consideration. She referenced previous projects and a Capital Times article advocating for more documentation of landmarks and buildings lost to new developments. She argued there were insufficient building images documenting the building prior to potential demolition for future historians and architects.\nCommissioner Heck was receptive to Bjorkman’s arguments and asked the development team if they would be open to documenting the building through photographs and redrawing building plans prior to demolition. While the team was open to photographs, Duane Johnson with the developer team was hesitant about documenting building plans. Johnson believed the Landmarks Commission already had substantial building plan documentation and was concerned about duplicating readily available resources.\nCommissioner Heck clarified he didn’t intend to imply developers needed new plans—only to ensure documentation was on file for future reference. Johnson agreed that between photos they would take and plans on file with the City, they could bridge the gap to meet the documentation level Bjorkman argued for.\nBoth items passed with the condition of proper photographic documentation for future reference following demolition.\n\n\n2025 Plan Commission Member Survey Results\nLegistar 89885: Discussion of survey results.\nFeedback indicated staff reports were generally favorable regarding background information. However, one comment observed that applicants provide extensive project details. The comment suggested that if the letter of intent provided necessary information, it could be cross-referenced in the Staff Report rather than repeated in findings, ultimately shortening project descriptions provided by staff.\nComments were made about how Staff Reports highlight conditions for approval. Traditionally, reports emphasize conditions they don’t think can be met or where the Plan Commission should spend additional time determining if conditions can be met. It was suggested the analysis include conditions that have been or could easily be met as a cross-reference for findings.\nThere was also a request regarding the time Staff Reports are released and when the Plan Commission is tasked with taking action on items. The City is looking into extending lead time and whether they have capacity to move up internal deadlines to provide information earlier. They explored moving meeting nights, but other days didn’t meet Plan Commission member constraints, so Mondays would remain the scheduled meeting day.\n\n\n\nAugust 25, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on August 25, 2025, revisiting the controversial tree protection ordinance and discussing significant changes to area planning policies that could affect future housing density.\n\nTree Protection Ordinance Approved\nLegistar 89254\n\n\n\nTree Protection Ordinance Reasons\n\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved changes to the city’s tree protection ordinance, expanding protection zones from a uniform 5 feet to 1 foot per inch of tree trunk diameter. The city presented additional evidence of tree damage on job sites and encroachments on the current 5-foot protection zone to justify the changes.\n\n\n\nCity Tree Damage Examples\n\n\n\n\n\nCity Tree Damage Examples\n\n\nStakeholder Input: City forestry staff met with Smart Growth Madison, a developer advocacy group, to address concerns. Smart Growth continued to argue for deferral, particularly concerned that tree damage by contractors could result in permit revocation.\nThe Realtors Association requested clearer processes for handling violations, agreeing that continued violations should have consequences but arguing that minor infractions should have compliance pathways short of permit revocation. They also wanted clarification that the tree protection zone stops at private property lines.\nPublic Support: Several speakers supported the ordinance changes, arguing that residents have had to constantly fight to protect trees during construction, that current modest penalties don’t adequately protect trees, and that street trees are especially important when private trees are removed for density.\nImplementation Details: Alder Guequierre explained that at the Finance Committee, sponsors emphasized implementing serious consequences for intentional tree destruction, noting that some bad actors currently agree to save street trees then simply pay damages after cutting them down.\nThe city indicated they hope to negotiate tree protection processes upfront, with any damages reviewed by Public Works if developers disagree with Forestry staff decisions.\nCommissioner Solheim clarified the appeals process: violations that can’t be resolved between developers and Forestry could result in permit suspension, with appeals going to the next Public Works meeting.\nCommissioner Field moved to pass the ordinance while requesting clarity that the protection zone applies only to public right-of-way and that negative consequences apply only to unauthorized damage. Commissioner Solheim also wanted clarity about the revocation process.\n\n\nArea Planning Policy Changes\nThe Commission discussed significant proposed changes to area planning policies, including the controversial “escalator clause” that allows increased density in Low-Medium Residential (LMR) and Low Residential (LR) districts under certain conditions.\nEscalator Clause Elimination:\n\n\n\nLMR Escalator Clause\n\n\nStaff proposed eliminating the escalator clause for LMR districts, arguing it would increase transparency by having density determined solely by land use categories rather than subjective Plan Commission decisions. Staff previously attempted to eliminate this clause during interim updates but additional criteria were added instead.\n\n\n\nLMR Escalator Clause\n\n\nThe Old Sauk Road development utilized this escalator clause for increased density.\n\n\n\nEscalator Clause Example\n\n\nStaff Rationale: Staff argued they want to reserve Low-Medium Residential for “missing middle” housing rather than apartment buildings, while retaining the escalator clause for LR districts. They suggested some LMR areas might be reclassified as Medium Residential (MR) to accommodate density.\n\n\n\nLMR Range\n\n\nCommission Concerns: Commissioner Heck worried about losing the ability to approve more housing, noting recent projects like Old Sauk Road and Northport developments benefited from the escalator clause. Staff indicated the 5-year comprehensive plan updates could allow land use changes to increase density.\nCommissioner Figueroa Cole expressed skepticism that eliminating the escalator clause would dramatically increase clarity while retaining it for LR districts, worrying it would reverse progress in finding appropriate density locations.\nAlder Guequierre questioned whether areas like the recent Old Sauk Road development could ever be categorized as Medium Residential given community pushback, highlighting a key concern about the practical limitations of the staff approach.\nAlternative Approaches: Commissioner Field suggested reducing escalator clause density allowances by half rather than eliminating them entirely. Commissioner Solheim wanted suggestions for increased density to be introduced earlier in area planning processes to avoid surprising the public.\nCommercial/Employment District Restrictions: Staff also proposed specifying which General Commercial and Employment districts are inappropriate for residential use, potentially requiring land use category changes before allowing housing in such areas.\n\n\n\nLimiting Residential in Commercial Districts\n\n\nAlder Glenn emphasized the value of flexibility in examining area nuances, while Commissioner Solheim wanted the ability to alter future land use designations if residential becomes appropriate.\nStaff’s goal is to bar certain commercial and employment areas from residential uses, arguing they aren’t suitable places for people to live.\n\n\nHousing Approvals\nThe Commission approved two significant housing projects on the consent agenda:\n\nFair Oaks Avenue Mixed-Use Development\nLegistar 88777\nConditional use approval for a five-story, 171-unit mixed-use building and 6-unit townhouse at 922-930 N Fair Oaks Avenue.\n\n\n\nFair Oaks Development\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Avenue Development\nLegistar 89230\nApproval for a 70-unit building at 3236-3300 Commercial Avenue.\n\n\n\nCommercial Avenue Development\n\n\nThe meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between environmental protection and development facilitation, while also revealing significant policy debates about how to manage future housing density in Madison’s evolving neighborhoods. The proposed elimination of density escalation tools drew considerable skepticism from commissioners concerned about limiting housing production flexibility.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 11, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on August 11, 2025, with significant discussion focused on proposed tree protection ordinance changes and housing development approvals.\n\nTree Protection Ordinance\nThe Commission extensively discussed a proposed ordinance that would significantly expand tree protection requirements for development projects affecting trees in the public right-of-way.\n\n\n\nTree Protection Ordinance\n\n\nKey Proposed Changes: - Extend the “tree protection zone” from 5 feet to 1 foot per inch of trunk diameter - Increase fines for removing trees from $125 to $150 per trunk diameter - Require developers to involve city staff to create protection plans for any work that might affect trees, including equipment exhaust - Grant authority to suspend or cancel permits for violations\nEnforcement Approach: Staff acknowledged that current fines are insufficient deterrents, noting that removing an old tree should ideally cost closer to $50,000. Since they cannot incorporate such high fines into the ordinance, they hope the risk of permit suspensions will effectively protect trees.\nCommission Concerns: Commissioner Heck expressed concern that negotiations between Urban Forestry and developers might lack transparency and not be obvious to approving bodies like the Plan Commission. He requested more information be made available to oversight bodies.\nCommissioner Solheim raised concerns that tree condition is not adequately accounted for in the ordinance.\nCommissioner Field wanted more information from stakeholders about potential impacts before proceeding.\nScope and Implementation: The ordinance applies only to trees in the public right-of-way (typically along streets) and use of land in the public right-of-way. Urban Forestry would not control use of private land, though larger portions of development sites could become subject to staff management.\nThe changes would require certified arborists to measure tree diameter for any work in the public right-of-way.\nOutreach Concerns: Commissioners noted that Urban Forestry had not conducted extensive outreach on the proposal. Staff could not answer questions about balancing pedestrian infrastructure needs with tree protection when building sidewalks and bike paths, and had not consulted with developers about the changes’ impacts.\nCommission Action: The Commission unanimously voted to refer the ordinance to the next meeting, expressing skepticism about the current proposal and requesting better outreach to developers both large and small about potential impacts.\nNotably, the ordinance sponsors are generally pro-housing advocates, and the proposal was also referred by the Public Works Committee.\n\n\nHousing Approval\n\nNorth Butler Street Development\nLegistar 121 N Butler\n\n\n\nNorth Butler Street Development\n\n\nThe Commission approved on the consent agenda a 73-unit apartment building at 121 N Butler Street.\n\n\n\nPlanning Process Updates\nDowntown Area Plan: The downtown area planning process timeline is being accelerated to coincide with the University of Wisconsin-Madison planning process.\n\n\n\nDowntown Area Plan\n\n\nEconomic Strategy Coordination: The planning process will also align with the Madison Inc Economic Strategy planning process to ensure coordinated development approaches.\n\n\n\nPublic Engagement Plan\n\n\nThe meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between environmental protection and development facilitation, with commissioners seeking greater transparency and stakeholder input in policy development processes.\n\n\n\nJuly 28, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz\n\nElection of Officers\nPlan Commission began with the election of officers. The following were elected uncontested.\n\nChair: Commissioner Gnam\nVice-chair: Commissioner Solheim\nTransportation Commission Appointment: Commissioner McCahil\nJoint Campus Area Committee: Commissioner Heck\n\n\n\nRevising the Area Plan Sequence\nLegistar 89107\nPlan Commission approved an adjustment to the Area Plan schedule so that the Downtown Area Plan coincides with other Downtown Madison and UW-Madison Campus planning. They also approved a delay to the Comprehensive Plan update so that more Area Plans can be finished before then. The city will also be delaying the complete Comprehensive Plan rewrite to 2033 to allow staff to focus on Area Plans. Although state law requires a comprehensive plan update every 10 years, according to staff our 5-year minimal plan updates count as satisfying this requirement.\n\n\n\nArea Plan Schedule\n\n\n\n\nAllow Excess Parking in a TOD Overlay\nLegistar 88775\nPlan Commission allowed a parking expansion to around double the allowed amount at 1502-1702 Pankratz Street in a TOD overlay, with only McCahil voting against (with Wasniewski excluded as a non-voting member). The property is owned by the construction company MSA, and they claimed that because of the nature of their business they have greater parking needs than most businesses. For instance, their employees may need to go to construction sites or meet clients who are not nearby or on a bus route. Many of their staff also do not live in Madison or on a bus route.\n\n\n\nExcess Parking Plan\n\n\nCity staff support the request, and their report lays out why they believe the developer has satisfied the conditions of approval. Although commissioners McCahil and Wasniewski didn’t think that the developer provided adequate evidence that they needed parking nearly double what is allowed in the TOD overlay, having only provided a picture of their parking lot full of cars rather than a parking depend study, other alders and commissioners thought that the developer had provided enough evidence. Alder Field worried that any denial of the parking request could be reversed by a court, as was the case recently of a car wash denied conditional use in a TOD on East Washington Ave. Alder Guequierre wondered whether construction businesses like this one may require more parking than some other uses.\n\n\n\nConditions of Approval for Excess Parking\n\n\nLegistar 88718\nIn Eastmoreland the Common Grace congregation sought Planned Development (PD) rezoning to allow them to demolish their current church at 3565 Tulane Ave. and build a 7000sq ft community center that will include a church, in addition to a 26 unit apartment building. Although the city typically does not use PD zoning for new developments, as it is a custom-made zoning to each lot, the inclusion of both a community center and housing required the rezoning from Traditional Residential (TR-C2) to a Planned Development.\n\n\n\nTulane Ave. Community Center, Church and Housing\n\n\nThe housing in this location will consist of 18 studios, three one-bedrooms, 4 two-bedrooms, and 1 three-bedrooms. The developer said that the large number of studios on this site would make the apartments more affordable (target at &lt; 80% Area Median Income), though it would not be subsidized. Several neighbors spoke out in support of the development, though one neighbor said that she had just learned about the plans for the church (even though there was a community meeting about it) and worried about people living in small apartments in such density.\nPlan Commmission recommended the zoning change to Council unanimously, with several members saying that they were impressed by the development’s ability to bring affordable housing to this area while retaining the community gathering place.\n\n\n\nCommon Grace Church’s Current Building\n\n\n\n\nAlteration at Development for Red Caboose Site\nLegistar 88776\nOn the consent agenda Plan Commission approved a major alteration to an approved building to replace the Red Caboose at 656 Willy St. The building will be larger, going from 45 to 53 units and now fully 5 stories. The old plans called for a part of it to be 3 stories. The first approval was controversial because of concerns about maintaining Jennifer St. Capitol views.\n\n\n\nComparison between new and old plans at 656 Willy\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 7, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nOfficial Minutes\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on July 7, 2025, approving several significant housing developments and advancing key “Housing Forward” zoning initiatives aimed at streamlining residential development across the city.\n\nMajor Housing Approvals\n\nNorthport Drive Multi-Family Development\nLegistar 88336\n\n\n\nNorthport Drive Development\n\n\nThe Commission approved on the consent agenda a four-story, 80-unit apartment building at 709 Northport Drive in a planned multi-use site that will also contain a proposed four-story, 24-unit apartment building and an existing place of worship. The project included approval of a certified survey map for the lot split adjacent to the church.\n\n\nCity View Drive Mixed-Use Complex\nLegistar 88551\n\n\n\nCity View Drive Development\n\n\nThe Commission approved a large-scale development at 2222-2304 City View Drive consisting of multiple buildings of various sizes, including a four-story mixed-use building containing approximately 4,600 square feet of commercial space and 60 apartments, plus a four-story 47-unit apartment building, a five-story 39-unit apartment building, and a five-story 40-unit apartment building. The project also included approval of a certified survey map.\n\n\n\nReiland Grove Subdivision\n\nControversial Residential Development\nLegistar 88449 & Legistar 88206\nThe more controversial item involved a residential subdivision by Veridian on current farmland at Commercial Avenue and Reiner Road. The Commission unanimously recommended approval of both the rezoning and preliminary plat for “Reiland Grove” to the Common Council.\n\n\n\nReiland Grove Subdivision\n\n\nCommunity Concerns: One public speaker expressed concern that this is entirely a residential, car-oriented development without any commercial component. The speaker also raised issues about the width of streets and alleys in the development, noting a 100-foot right-of-way that may allow for high speeds without parked cars.\n\n\n\nExample Streets in Right of Way\n\n\nDeveloper Response: The developer noted that the city’s comprehensive plan calls for commercial development south of the residential area. Both the developer and staff indicated that commercial development often follows after residential demand is established.\n\n\n\nCity Plan for the Area - subdivision in red square\n\n\nProject Evolution: The city required the developer to relocate several residential lots around the proposed city park because they were thought to encroach on park uses, resulting in a larger public park. The development also includes a private park. The preliminary plat includes several outlots in the southeast designated for future development, which may include multifamily and/or mixed-use components.\n\n\n\nOriginal Park Design\n\n\nDevelopment Timeline: The subdivision will be developed over the next 15 years, with specific street design details to be determined later. Currently, only the geometry of lots and street right-of-ways are being established.\n\n\n\nHousing Forward Zoning Initiatives\nThe Commission advanced three major zoning changes under the “Housing Forward” initiative, all receiving unanimous recommendations for approval at the following week’s Common Council meeting:\n\nDuplexes in All Residential Zones\nLegistar 88736\n\n\n\nDuplex Zoning Change\n\n\nThe Commission recommended allowing duplexes in all single-family zones, though not in Planned Development (PD) zones. This change builds on recent modifications to duplex policies that allowed more configurations of two-unit buildings, with some potentially created through internal conversions of existing homes.\n\n\nFlag Lot Development\nLegistar 88735\nThe Commission approved changes to facilitate “flag lot” divisions, which break a single large lot into multiple lots by extending a thin driveway portion to the street with the new lot placed at the rear. The changes will decrease the required width of the driveway portion, standardize lot size and setbacks, and streamline the approval process.\n\n\n\nFlag Lot Changes\n\n\nCommissioner Guequierre raised questions about potential conflicts with existing private covenants. Staff explained that the city does not track private agreements, but legal action could be taken if such covenants exist and are violated.\n\n\nDowntown Apartment Streamlining\nLegistar 88737\nThe Commission recommended allowing more medium-sized apartment buildings to be built by right (without Plan Commission review) in downtown districts: - In DC and UMX districts: increase height limit by right from 4 to 6 stories - DR1 district: increase by-right units from 4 to 12 units - DR2 district: increase by-right units from 8 to 36 units\n\n\n\nDC and UMX Zone Changes\n\n\n\n\n\nDR1 Zone Changes\n\n\n\n\n\nDR2 Zone Changes\n\n\nCommission Concerns: Commissioner Heck expressed concern about how buildings adjacent to landmarks would be reviewed, noting this represents another policy that appears to empower the Landmarks Commission. Commissioner Solheim questioned what would happen if Landmarks requested changes to a permitted building and who would review such decisions if not the Plan Commission.\nStaff explained that for downtown buildings permitted by right, Landmarks serves in an advisory capacity to the Urban Design Commission (UDC) and staff for approvals “using the standards that are in the ordinance.” Landmarks makes final decisions for landmark buildings and those in historic districts, while UDC decides matters for buildings adjacent to landmarks.\nCommissioner Heck requested that staff map out the roles of various commissions in approving apartments that become permitted uses to avoid future misunderstandings about Landmarks/UDC authority.\n\n\n\nAdditional Approvals\n\nCemetery Expansion\nLegistar 88555 - Conditional use for crypt addition to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux Cathedral at 2438-2462 Atwood Avenue\n\n\nAdditional Survey Maps and Zoning\nLegistar 88557 - Certified Survey Map for property at 1626 and 1634 Baker Avenue\nLegistar 88717 - Zoning assignment for property at 60 White Oaks Lane\nThe meeting demonstrated the Commission’s continued focus on expanding housing options while addressing concerns about the evolving roles of various city commissions in the development review process.\n\n\n\n\nJune 23, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on June 23, 2025, approving several significant development projects including a contentious 93-unit affordable housing development that sparked debate about comprehensive planning and residential safety standards.\n\nMajor Affordable Housing Approval\n\nVerona Road Mixed-Use Development\nLegistar 87879\nThe Commission unanimously approved a conditional use for a five-story mixed-use building at 4506-4514 Verona Road containing 324 square feet of commercial space and 93 apartments. This project became the evening’s most controversial item due to concerns about comprehensive plan consistency and pedestrian safety.\n\n\n\nVerona Road Development\n\n\nProject Details: - 45 one-bedroom units - 23 two-bedroom units\n- 25 two-bedroom units - Approximately 1 parking space per unit (underground) - 324 square feet of rentable commercial space - WHEDA-funded affordable housing - On-site amenities include play area, community room, and case-management space\nStaff Concerns: The item was referred from the previous meeting, with staff expressing concerns that the location is designated as general commercial in the comprehensive plan and may be inconsistent with residential use. Staff noted the site is designed for big-box retail development, and the comprehensive plan calls for commercial rather than residential use.\n\n\n\nVerona Road Site\n\n\nMadison Police Department expressed skepticism about pedestrian safety and anticipated more service calls. Routes to nearby parks require crossing Verona Road, and the frontage road carries approximately 3,500 cars per day.\nApplicant Response: The developer addressed traffic and highway proximity concerns by describing sound mitigation measures, sheltered open spaces, and walkability to parks and groceries. They assured that the shared driveway with University Book Store would not be affected.\n\n\n\nNearby Bus Routes\n\n\n\n\n\nNearby Bike Routes\n\n\nCommunity Opposition: The Orchard Ridge Neighborhood Association, located west of the site, expressed concerns about traffic safety in the area. Some residents characterized the placement of low-income housing in this location as “modern redlining” and creating a “polluted ghetto.” One resident specifically mentioned concerns about increased police calls associated with the low-income development.\nPlanning Discussion: The project highlighted tensions between housing needs and comprehensive planning. While the site is already zoned Commercial Center (CC), which allows residential use through conditional use permits, the comprehensive plan designates the area for general commercial use. Staff noted that conditional uses don’t necessarily need to be consistent with the comprehensive plan, but the plan serves as evidence for appropriateness.\nA key issue was the developer’s use of minimal commercial space (~350 square feet) to classify the project as “mixed use,” thereby exceeding the 50-unit limit typically allowed in the zone - a strategy described as exploiting a zoning code loophole to enable more housing.\nCommission Decision: Chair Gnam questioned the applicant’s walk time calculations, noting her own 12-minute walk to a park the applicant claimed was 4 minutes away.\nAlder Field questioned why general commercial areas shouldn’t allow housing when mixed-use areas do. Staff explained that recent area plan changes from mixed-use to general commercial were made due to proximity to freeways or large commercial developments inconsistent with housing.\nAlder Guequierre moved to approve the conditional use, stating that walking times to amenities and the Southwest Path support housing at this location. He noted that he personally walked the area and found pedestrian access “very good” without “a scary amount of traffic.” He suggested that big-box retail patterns are changing nationally and locally, and that the Southwest Area Plan might alter future land use designations.\nCommissioner Wasniewski supported approval, saying his children had traversed the area safely in the past.\nThe Commission found that conditional use standards 1, 2, 4, and 8 were met based on: - Additional information in supplemental materials - Safety and ease of pedestrian access, including paths and crosswalks - Available access to parks and amenities - Plans for improvements at Britta Park - Potential long-term transitions of large-format retail areas\n\n\n\nUniversity Bay Drive Projects\n\nLakeshore Nature Preserve Visitor Center\nLegistar 87841, Legistar 87657, & Legistar 88477\nThe Commission recommended approval of rezoning property at 1970-1978 University Bay Drive from CN (Conservancy) to PR (Parks and Recreation) District and conditional uses for an 11,500 square-foot visitor center for the Lakeshore Nature Preserve on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. The project also included street vacation and realignment to accommodate the development.\nCommissioner Mendez recused himself from these items due to his employment with UW-Madison and direct involvement in the proposal.\n\n\n\nEast Washington Avenue Development\n\nWMC Foundation Building Replacement\nLegistar 88203, Legistar 88204, & Legistar 88209\n\n\n\nWMC Building Replacement\n\n\nThe Commission approved demolition of an office building at 501 E Washington Avenue and conditional uses for a seven-story, 223-unit apartment building in Urban Design District 4. The project also included a certified survey map approval.\n\n\n\nTax Incremental Financing Districts\nThe Commission approved several TID amendments, including:\nLegistar 88728 - Tax Incremental District #55 (Voit Farm) for affordable housing development\nAdditional TID approvals: - Legistar 88724 - TID #42 (Wingra) amendment - Legistar 88725 - TID #45 (Capitol Square West) amendment\n- Legistar 88726 - TID #48 (Regent Street) amendment - Legistar 88727 - TID #53 (East Wilson Street) amendment\n\n\nReferred Items\nSeveral items were re-referred to future meetings at applicant requests:\n\nLegistar 88449 & Legistar 88206 - Reiland Grove development with 264 single-family lots and multi-family residences (re-referred to July 7, 2025)\nLegistar 88341 - Private school conditional use at 1402 Pankratz Street (re-referred to future meeting)\nLegistar 88336 - 80-unit apartment building at 709 Northport Drive (re-referred to July 7, 2025)\n\n\n\nAdditional Approvals\nLegistar 88450 - Rezoning 1138 Williamson Street from TR-V2 to TSS (Traditional Shopping Street)\nThe meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between housing advocacy and comprehensive planning, with the Verona Road decision demonstrating the Commission’s willingness to prioritize housing development even when it conflicts with adopted land use plans. The discussion underscored the importance of comprehensive plan designations in determining development appropriateness and revealed strategies developers use to maximize housing density within existing zoning frameworks.\n\n\n\nJune 9, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on June 9, 2025, approving several significant housing developments and multiple zoning code amendments to streamline development processes.\n\nZoning Code Amendments\n\nConditional Use Extensions Clarification\nLegistar 88003\nStaff presented proposed language changes to clarify that conditional uses for alterations are eligible for time extensions, not just the projects themselves. The goal was to make it clearer that Plan Commission approval is also extended when the City extends it, up to one year.\nLinda Leferntz, the first registered speaker, agreed that extensions hadn’t been an issue in the past but voiced concern that the proposed language could still be clearer and might be misused by staff and developers because it was “too broad.” Commissioner Bhasin questioned what specific problem the language change was trying to address.\nZoning Administrator Katie Bannon explained that alterations do not need to come back to Plan Commission if they’re minor, but the current language makes it seem as if the Commission cannot approve minor alterations if they are approved by the city. The modification clarifies that Plan Commission approval is also extended when the City extends it.\nAfter clarification, the item passed unanimously.\n\n\nPlace of Worship Requirements\nLegistar 88006\nAlthough part of the zoning packet, Linda Leonards spoke in strong opposition to changes regarding place of worship capacity requirements. She claimed “600 is too many for capacity,” mentioning that the same type of higher classification street requires conditional use. She argued the conditional use would no longer give preference to smaller, local streets. Despite her opposition, the Plan Commission passed the item unanimously.\n\n\nRestaurant and Alcohol-Related Uses\nLegistar 88319\nStaff Bannon presented changes to streamline alcohol and entertainment licensing. Currently, Madison requires an additional entertainment license (beyond conditional use) if you have an alcohol license and want amplified sound indoors. The proposed changes aim to be quicker to obtain and more business-friendly while placing less administrative burden on the City.\nLinda Leonards spoke passionately against the changes, referencing the Plan B controversy from the mid-2010s, where the Alcohol License Review Committee (ALRC) could not consider intended use with licenses like the Plan Commission can with conditional use applications. She argued that indoor amplified music can disturb neighborhoods, noting that Plan B could be heard in people’s houses with vibrations felt throughout the neighborhood. She also mentioned “drunks stumbling through the neighborhood at 2am, making random porches their home for the night.”\nCommissioner Bhasin asked about different factors taken into account with licenses. Bannon gave an overview of ALRC powers, noting that ALRC can impose various conditions with entertainment licenses and that license revocation significantly impacts businesses.\nAlder Figueroa Cole moved to eliminate the restaurant-nightclub wording because “they do not go hand-in-hand, the definitions are changing.” The amended proposal passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nUniversity Avenue Mixed-Use Project\nLegistar 88325 & 87881\nThe Commission approved a six-story mixed-use building at 3535-3553 University Avenue and 733-737 N Meadow Lane containing approximately 4,300 square feet of commercial space and 146 apartments. The project required rezoning from TR-C1 to CC-T and multiple conditional uses.\n\n\n\nUniversity Ave. Side\n\n\nStaff Colin Punt noted the applicant had previously received approval for a five-story building but now wanted approval for six stories. Staff raised questions about approval standard regarding building height, as the permitted height is five stories and this would exceed permissions. The previous design exceeded almost 30 feet above the transition line, but the current design exceeds about 12 feet because of step-backs to houses to the north.\n\n\n\nMeadow Lane Side\n\n\nThe developer team, including Randy Christianson from JLA Architects and Walter Briggs Development, had conducted neighborhood meetings. They requested conditional approval for setbacks at the back of the building rather than the front to maintain building quality, and asked for the sixth floor for community mixed-use. The project includes 7-foot sidewalks to aid bike and pedestrian traffic.\nCommunity Concerns: - Thomas Meloney opposed the project due to traffic concerns, noting 71 units were already being added before this project and calling additional units “horrendous.” He suggested the Capitol Clinic and “Puff and Pass” store site should be used instead, with entrance and exit solely on University Avenue - Michael Pomrany, representing the “overwhelming majority” in favor of development, appreciated the traffic calming deposit but wanted to know when it would be assessed and requested stronger traffic calming efforts - Rick Kedzior, a neighbor with a fourth-grader, had safety concerns and recommended a four-times deposit increase and a 5-7 foot wide pedestrian island on Meadow Lane - Jesse Dury worried about westbound University traffic needing to access the residential area\n\n\n\nCurrent Building\n\n\nProject Details: - Studios rent for about $1,500/month (described as “market rate”) - Target residents are primarily professionals, UW Hospital employees, Epic employees, and occasional graduate students - All units will have yearly leases - Studios sell out fast, while two-bedroom units rent more slowly\nA $10,000 deposit was required for traffic calming measures if the City needs to alter traffic flow due to development pressure. The City Engineer plans to conduct speed studies after development completion to determine appropriate traffic calming measures.\nBoth items passed unanimously, though Alder Field was excused for this vote.\n\n\nMilwaukee Street Development\nLegistar 88200\n\n\n\nFirst Voit Farm Development\n\n\nThe Commission approved a four-story mixed-use building at 3450 Milwaukee Street containing approximately 6,200 square feet of commercial space and 156 apartments on Lot 4 and associated site improvements on Outlots 2 and 3 of the approved Starkweather plat (Voit Farm). The project passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nVoit Farm Development Plan\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Facility\nLegistar IDs 88198 & 88199\nThe Commission approved converting an assisted living facility at 842 Jupiter Drive into an approximately 54-bed residential substance abuse treatment facility with inpatient and outpatient counseling services.\nStaff explained the facility would not have significant negative impact on the surrounding community, largely due to an experienced director being brought in from their Brookfield location and an approved security plan. Staff determined that ample street parking plus a small staff parking lot would be sufficient.\nRyan Schneider, the director from Brookfield, outlined the need for the facility, noting that one in five people develop a substance disorder in their lifetime and highlighting 380 addiction deaths in Dane County in 2023 alone. Key facility details: - Exclusively treats voluntary clients - No sex offenders or people charged with violent offenses would be admitted - No EMS vehicles (unlike the current physical rehabilitation facility) - Scheduled admission only, reducing ambulance traffic - Treatment stays range from 30 to 45 days, with 45 days being most effective - Since residents won’t have cars, parking is only for outpatient treatment and staff - Additional leased space in Madison provides more parking for outpatient care if needed\nBoth items passed unanimously.\n\n\nPersonal Storage Facility\nLegistar 88201 & 88207\nThe Commission approved a personal indoor storage facility at 6901-6933 Manufacturers Drive. City staff noted that zoning requires the proposed building to be a minimum of two stories, but determined changes to the design could be altered to fit current zoning requirements.\n\n\n\nA 2-story self-storage?\n\n\nStaff cited concerns over future plans for the site regarding Dane County’s future intersection redesign. The lots may be required to convert ingress and egress rights to the interstate when there is a design change by the Department of Transportation, though the City doesn’t currently know when that may happen.\nWeston Zuleger, speaking for the development team, said “We really don’t have any issues at this point” with altering the design to meet zoning codes and potentially turning rights over to the DOT in the future.\nCommissioner Bhasin asked about effective facility designs. Alder Guequierre questioned why the developer was looking at including a decorative tower to satisfy the two-story requirement rather than adding more usable space, referencing a 2018 rule aimed at pushing for denser development.\nStaff Bannon clarified there are no specific language markers defining what constitutes a second story or required footprint, contrasting this with stricter zoning rules being imposed on 7 Brew Coffee planned for construction at the edge of the east side HyVee parking lot on East Washington Avenue.\nDespite some deliberation, both items passed unanimously.\n\n\nAdditional Approvals\nSeveral other items were approved on consent or with minimal discussion:\nLegistar 88329 - Street right-of-way vacation on Schewe Road\nLegistar 88195 - Conditional use for restaurant-tavern and food sales at 10 S Paterson Street\nLegistar 88202 - Demolition permit for single-family residence at 6105 S Highlands Avenue\nAdditional Zoning Amendments: - Legistar 88001 - SR-C3 District dimensional requirements - Legistar 88004 - Lakefront development setback requirements\n- Legistar 88005 - Lodge, Private Club, Reception Hall uses in Suburban Employment Districts\n\n\nReferred Items\nLegistar 87879 - A five-story mixed-use building at 4506-4514 Verona Road with 324 square feet of commercial space and 93 apartments was re-referred to the June 23, 2025 meeting at the applicant’s request.\nThe meeting demonstrates continued strong development activity in Madison, with the Commission balancing community concerns about traffic and neighborhood impacts against the city’s housing needs and development goals.\n\n\n\nJune 2, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Madison Plan Commission held a special in-person meeting on June 2, 2025, focusing on legal education for commissioners and updates on two major area planning processes.\n\nLand Use Law Education Session\nLegistar ID: 88387\nAssistant City Attorney Kate Smith provided commissioners with an overview of Wisconsin land use law and the Plan Commission’s role within that framework. The presentation highlighted the hierarchical nature of municipal land use authority.\n\n\n\nCreatures of the State\n\n\nAccording to meeting commentary, land use regulation in the United States is largely governed by state law, with Wisconsin granting cities significant authority to regulate zoning and set development conditions, but less latitude in determining whether individual developments meet those conditions.\n\n\n\nLand Use\n\n\nThe discussion outlined three levels of municipal authority, from most to least discretionary:\n\nComprehensive Plans: Cities have the most latitude when designing comprehensive plans, which describe the types of development and zoning changes the city will accept\nZoning Changes: Less latitude is available for zoning changes that are consistent with the comprehensive plan\nConditional Use Permits: The least discretion is available for conditional use permits\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Authority\n\n\n\nConditional Use Permit Framework\nThe session explained that conditional use permits exist because some uses, such as large apartment buildings, are considered generally acceptable in various zones but only if certain conditions are met through a review process. However, there remains an expectation that cities will approve applications when conditions are met.\nA key legal principle was illustrated through a recent court case: if a city denies a conditional use permit when the applicant has met all conditions and the city lacks reasons consistent with existing land-use ordinances, the applicant can successfully appeal to court. For example, a carwash development in a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) on East Washington Avenue was initially denied its conditional use permit partly due to traffic concerns, but the developers won in court because no objective traffic study had been conducted to demonstrate increased traffic impacts.\n\n\n\nConditional Use Permits\n\n\nThe legal framework incentivizes cities to clearly articulate their land use goals in comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances, which increases predictability for developers and property owners. Changes to comprehensive plans, in particular, can grant developers additional rights, such as the ability to build more housing.\n\n\n\nSouthwest and Southeast Area Plan Updates\nSouthwest Area Plan Legistar ID: 88388 Southeast Area Plan Legistar ID: 88389\nPlanning Division staff provided updates on both area planning processes for the Southeast and Southwest parts of the city, which are currently in the community engagement phase. The timeline calls for first draft plans to be developed in Fall 2025 with approvals targeted for Spring 2026.\n\n\n\nSouthwest Area Plan\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Area Plan\n\n\n\nCommunity Feedback\nStaff reported receiving diverse feedback from residents, with significant concerns raised about housing, transportation, and jobs throughout both planning areas.\n  \n\n\nSoutheast Area Focus\nAccording to meeting commentary, some of the most significant changes to land use and transportation patterns could occur in the southeast area. The city plans to address several key issues:\n\n\n\nSoutheast Concerns\n\n\n\nCorrecting inappropriate land-use recommendations along the Highway 151 corridor\nImproving connectivity across the highway\nRecommending sidewalks for any road reconstruction projects\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Concerns\n\n\nStaff noted that sidewalk recommendations, despite residents no longer being required to pay for them, are likely to be the most controversial element of any area plan.\n\n\n\nAdditional Business\nThe meeting also included member announcements about upcoming events:\n\nAlder Guequierre provided an update on the May 29, 2025 Smart Growth Madison housing summit titled “Building Blocks: The Housing Development Process and Financing”\nDarrin Wasniewski announced a June 4, 2025 AARP Wisconsin discussion on universal design in housing for aging in place\nAlder Glenn highlighted “Wear Orange Day” events scheduled for June 6-8 to promote gun safety awareness\n\n\n\n\nMay 19, 2025\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nNo substantive items were discussed at this meeting.\n\n\nMay 12, 2025\nBy Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Madison Plan Commission met virtually on May 12, 2025, to consider several development projects and policy updates, including revisions to the city’s code of conduct for elected and appointed officials.\n\nCode of Conduct Updates\nLegistar ID: 87483\nThe commission reviewed additions to the city code of conduct that would include provisions for the treatment of staff and members of the public. According to social media commentary on the meeting, the updates were characterized as covering obvious standards of behavior, and notably do not extend to social media conduct.\n  \n\n\nBear Claw Way Apartment Development\nLegistar ID: 87658\nThe commission unanimously approved a conditional use for a 21-unit apartment building at 305 Bear Claw Way/9453 Spirit Street in a new west side subdivision. The project consists of approximately 80% two-bedroom units with the remainder being one-bedroom apartments.\n\n\n\nStreetside\n\n\nA key discussion point centered on parking requirements. The developers requested 30 parking stalls, with most housed in single-stall garages. The Urban Design Commission (UDC) had recommended eliminating 4 parking stalls to extend green space, but Alder Guequierre moved to approve the building with the full 30 stalls as requested by the developers, ignoring the UDC recommendation.\n\n\n\nParking\n\n\nAlder Field noted during discussion that the location is approximately 1.5 miles from transit. The area will also have street parking available in addition to possible driveway parking in front of garage doors. Observers noted this represents a relatively low unit-to-parking ratio for the area.\n\n\nNakoma Road Rezoning Eliminates Restrictive Planned Development\nLegistar ID: 87842\nThe commission unanimously recommended approval of a rezoning at 3821 Nakoma Road from PD (Planned Development) to LMX (Limited Mixed Use). The case highlighted issues with Madison’s older, overly prescriptive zoning practices.\n\nThe property owner, who operates first-floor commercial space with second-floor residential, explained that the current PD zoning contains unusual restrictions requiring him to rent “to a family with not more than 2 children” or “single people working.” Staff noted that the two-story mixed-use building next to residential was exactly what the LMX district was designed for.\nAlder Field expressed satisfaction with eliminating another instance of PD zoning, stating that PD requirements are often hard to find and are less transparent than newer standardized zoning districts. PD zones, which are custom to each property, were very common in the past to customize zoning for individual developments.\n\n\nOther Business\nThe commission also approved on the consent agenda an 11,000 square foot visitor center at the base of Picnic Point, though this item was later referred to a future meeting date.\n\n\n\nThe New Picnic Point\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 28, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Plan Commission met Monday, April 28th to review several items; however, a considerable amount of the agenda was moved either to the consent agenda or moved to later meetings. Here’s the breakdown:\n\nConsent Agenda\n\nLegistar 87597: Creating Section 28.022-00709 of the Madison General Ordinances to change the zoning of property generally located at 149 Wisteria Street from SR-C2 (Suburban Residential-Consistent 2) District to TR-C3 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 3) District. (District 9)\nLegistar 87630: 722 Moorland Road (District 14): Consideration of a conditional use in the Suburban Residential-Consistent 3 (SR-C3) District for a housing cooperative.\nLegistar 87633: 1522 Waunona Way (District 14): Consideration of a conditional use to construct a single-family residence on a lakefront parcel.\nLegistar 87720: 2604 Waunona Way (District 14): Consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a single-family residence.\nLegistar 87655: 4313 Buckley Road, Town of Burke: Consideration of a Certified Survey Map within the City’s Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to create one residential lot.\nLegistar 87656: 6059 Portage Road, Town of Burke: Consideration of a Certified Survey Map within the City’s Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to create three residential lots.\n\n\n\nReferred to May 12th\n\nLegistar 87470: 345 W Main Street (District 4): Consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a 44-unit assisted living facility.\nLegistar 87598: Creating Section 28.022-00710 of the Madison General Ordinances to change the zoning of property located at 333-345 West Main Street, 110 South Henry Street, and 334 West Doty Street from PD (Planned Development) District to Amended PD (GDP) (Planned Development-General Development Plan) District and creating Section 28.022-00711 to approve a Specific Implementation Plan. (District 4)\n\n\n\nReferred to May 19th\n\nLegistar 83269: 709-711 E Johnson Street (District 6): Consideration of a conditional use in the Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMX) District for an outdoor eating area open past 9:00 p.m.\n\n\n\nMinocqua Brewing Company\nLegistar 87634\nThe most heated item on tonight’s agenda was in regard to the consideration of conditional use for Minocqua Brewing Company, located at 2927 E Washington Avenue in District 15. The request specifically asks for amplified sound on an outdoor eating patio for a tasting room in a Commercial Corridor-Transitional District (CC-T) District.\nStaff Chris Wells presented, reminding the Commission of the 2024 approval for the biergarten to have amplified sound until 9pm. According to the application, owner Kirk Bangstad does not anticipate having music going the entire window—only planning to have music and sound playing until 8:45pm; however, this contradicts the establishment’s prior behavior. According to Staff Wells, Minocqua Brewing was notified of a violation in October 2024 after reports of amplified sound coming from the biergarten after 9pm. Commissioner Heck later inquired into this notice, with City Inspector Matt Tucker offering some clarity into the complaint and the investigative process. Tucker, who was personally involved in the case, stated the City first receives a complaint. At that point, their office issues a notice while they look into the issue. If the notice resolves the issue, no further action is taken; however, if the behavior is not corrected, the establishment is issued a municipal citation and the case runs the potential to get referred daily to the City Attorney’s Office for legal action.\nIn this specific case, the City found an event had taken place in the backyard area after their 9pm cutoff. Additionally, the Inspector’s Office discovered a website with a list of upcoming music events in the patio area—several of which were stated to go past the 9pm cut-off. Tucker said Bangstad was sent a reminder about outdoor music being prohibited and that it was too late in the evening for these events. According to Tucker, Minocqua Brewing was not cited as the behavior was corrected.\nAlong with noting the notice, Staff Wells drew attention to only eight of the previous 78 applications similar to Minocqua’s having been approved. Of those eight, the median distance to the nearest residence was 138 feet, compared to 40 feet in this case. While Bangstad’s application does include sound dampening measures, Staff still raised concern over previous violations with sound amplification. Ultimately, the Staff Report recommended placing the application on file without prejudice.\nBangstad was the first to speak during the public hearing, kicking things off with a passionate and well-rehearsed speech. The Minocqua Brewing Company Owner reminisced over a Parisian cafe once frequented by late American icons, expressing his desire to create the same atmosphere right here in Wisconsin. Then, the reign of Donald Trump and the COVID-19 Pandemic threatened his business—ultimately forcing him out of his original Minocqua location. Bangstad placed a great deal of blame on “Trumpers” and politics. Despite shared liberal views, Bangstad went on to state “Madison is a sanctuary from the worst Wisconsin has become… unfortunately politics got in the way again [of his idea Biergarten Cafe].”\nAlex Sherwood, who lives on the neighboring property, provided testimony in stark contrast to Bangstad’s. Sherwood argued wherever sound is amplified there is “stress and conflict,” but stated “this is different.” Any time the patio is open, Sherwood and their partner can hear conversations from inside their home—calling the location an “acoustic marvel” with how effortlessly the concrete design causes sound to bounce around and amplify. While Sherwood and their spouse are musicians, and love their neighborhood because of its focus on the arts, the sound has become a major source of stress. They would rather be in their yard writing about joy, instead they are stuck documenting sound disturbances. As part of their final statement, Sherwood referenced the potential one-year trial period in the proposal before tonight’s commission members, but reminded them of the previous year’s misconduct. According to the neighbor, Minocqua Brewing has basically already had a year trial period full of disturbances and violations. Another year would simply lead to additional agitation and stress.\nNick Pjevak, who previously served as Chair for the City of Madison’s Arts Commission, acknowledged both sides of the evening’s debate. While he urged the City to be more supportive of the arts, he agreed with Staff and Sherwood that the condensed nature of our city has its drawbacks. Drawing on two examples, Pjevak praised the Harmony Bar for their ability to meet zoning requirements while also maintaining a conscious effort towards being good stewards of sound in their neighborhood.\nAlder Field began by asking about the October violation and what steps had been taken to ensure it did not happen again. Bangstad claimed to be unaware, saying he did not know anything about activities going later than 9pm. Rather than answering the second half of Alder Field’s question, Bangstad took the opportunity to take a jab at their neighbor, claiming Sherwood is simply building a record to hurt their Biergarten, to which he quickly realized his misstep and added an acknowledgment of their relationship not being great, but “it is what it is.” Meanwhile, Alder Guequerre was more interested to hear what other neighbors had to say about the situation and called on the representative present from the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood. Doug Johnson responded, noting the email they sent in mostly echoes Staff’s comments about not meeting condition three of the zoning appropriateness. Johnson drew further attention to the proposal’s only inclusion of noise dampening being putting blankets on the fence. According to Johnson, this would not help with sound going up to neighbors’ second floors or deter noise from bouncing up into bedrooms. Newly elected Alder Carmela Glenn (District 18) also noted this later, asking for Bangstad to be more specific with how the sound dampening would work. The owner stated that the Minocqua Brewing Company would allow the sound to bounce off patrons, then onto the barriers included in the proposal, before dissipating. Alder Glenn did not follow up, but did not seem impressed with the answer as it did not address the issue of sound reaching the second floor.\nNewly elected Alder Pritchett took a much gentler approach when conversing with Bangstad, despite her authoritative undertone. While she urged the owner to engage with neighbors more to offer clarity and foster better relations, Alder Pritchett reminded Bangstad that “after all, the neighborhood was there before you came… you’re going to have to do some work. And that means engaging them. That will buy you a whole lot of currency.” Alder Pritchett then asked what attempts would be made moving forward to connect with the residents and Bangstad once again became flustered. He immediately referenced the 120 decibels from the F35s quaking the buildings every day to compare to the amplified sound he proposes—“maybe every now and then you hear some opera, or some jazz, or some Celtic music” before making another direct dig at his neighbors, saying “maybe that isn’t enough for some people [to have music instead of jets].”\nUltimately, the Plan Commission voted to place the Minocqua Brewing Company’s application on file without prejudice.\n\n\nBrennan’s Market\nLegistar 87636\nThe final item of the night was a similar application for Brennan’s Market, located at 8216 Watts Road in District 1. Specifically, the consideration of an alteration to an approved Planned Development District-Specific Implementation Plan (PD-SIP) to amend the zoning text to remove the prohibition of outdoor amplified sound and add conditional uses, as well as the consideration of a conditional use in the Planned Development (PD) District for a restaurant-nightclub and consideration of a conditional use in the PD District for amplified sound in an outdoor eating area, all to allow a winery to be converted into a restaurant-nightclub with amplified sound in an existing outdoor eating area. Simply put, Brennan’s wants to expand the existing eating area tied to their deli and wine market to include a more welcoming environment—which includes outdoor music.\nStaff Wells once again presented, reminding the Commission of a previous zoning amendment that allowed amplified sound from 11am to 11pm and outdoor seating for up to 25 people. In this case, the applicant wants to change the conditional use to include a restaurant-nightclub to accommodate alcohol sales. While Brennan’s is a wine vendor, they currently do not sell wine by the glass. The applicant would also like to host live music events outside seasonally, roughly one to two times per week anywhere from 9am to 9pm, which would be well within the previous amendment’s allowance. Wells specified that the nearest residence is 160 feet from the patio—landing above the median for previously approved applications. This is in addition to the parking area between the residence and Brennan’s, as well as a cross street (Commerce Drive). Overall, staff were optimistic and believed the standards to be met, pending a six month trial period.\nDespite Staff’s positive recommendation, the neighboring All Saints Neighborhood, a 55+ community located across Watts Road, submitted their opposition. Included with concerns by residents were those of doctors and treating specialists involved with the care of a number of the All Saints residents. Commissioner Heck specifically asked Brennan’s owner, Tim Mulcahy, if the applicant would have any issue not playing music until after 3pm, Monday through Friday. Mulcahy said there would be no issue—emphasizing they do not want to have early music, how their neighbors are their patrons, and that they just want to “add dimension” to their surrounding community. The applicant went on to clarify they only envision utilizing the conditions Thursdays through Sundays after 5pm to draw people in; furthermore, they want to make sure all parties are happy in this whole scenario. Mulcahy reassured the Commission “our business is not hanging in the balance by this approval or denial, just adding a layer of ambiance and excitement to the venue.”\nAlder Pritchett joined the conversation, giving some constructive criticism on how to better connect with neighbors and assuage the concerns of the All Saints Neighborhood. Most notably, Alder Pritchett encouraged Mulcahy to include music that would appeal to their elderly neighbors—something they could sit on their patios and listen to. Mulcahy excitedly told Alder Pritchett, “you are definitely hired as my event coordinator for sure!” This was followed by praise from Alder Harrington-McKinny, who commended Mulcahy for “wanting to be a good neighbor” to a group that is often excluded.\nAs a group, many acknowledged previous complaints made against Cider Farm, who attempted a similar venture prior to the Brennan’s application. Alder Duncan specifically asked about issues with the former leases, to which Mulcahy responded they were not sure who made the complaints; however, they would be interested in finding out so as to ensure their comfort and prevent them from being disturbed unreasonably in any way. Alder Guequerre followed up for clarification regarding the intended hours of live music, asking if changing the language to disallow amplified music Monday through Friday would have a significant impact on the applicant. Mulcahy said although they had hoped to include Thursdays for music, limiting to weekends only was an amenable compromise.\nIn the end, Alder Guequerre moved to approve the application with specific conditions provided by Staff, limiting music to Saturdays and Sundays only from 5pm to 9pm. The motion was seconded by Alder Glenn and passed.\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nTuesday night Madison was treated to another short and sweet Plan Commission meeting, with the ten items being passed with the evening’s consent agenda and three items making it to the floor—two of which were bundled together.\n\nConsent agenda items included:\n\nLegistar 87610: Determining a Public Purpose and Necessity and adopting a Transportation Project Plat Number. 5992-10-19, City of Madison, Mineral Point Road - USH 12 to Highpoint Rd for the acquisitions per the Plat of Land and Interests required. Located in the Southeast 1/4 of the Southwest 1/4 of Section 23, Township 7 North, Range 8 East, in the City of Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin. (District 9)\nLegistar 87450: Amending various sections of Chapter 28 of the Madison General Ordinances related to lodging to allow hotel and motel rentals of thirty days or more.\nLegistar 87462: 306 N Brooks Street (District 8): Consideration of a conditional use pursuant to MGO Section 28.134(3) for projections into the Capitol View Preservation Limit to allow rooftop mechanical space and an elevator overrun for a previously approved 15-story, 189-unit apartment building.\nLegistar 87463: 414 S Baldwin Street (District 6): Consideration of an alteration of an approved conditional use in the Traditional Shopping Street (TSS) District to amend the conditions of approval for a hotel and restaurant-tavern with outdoor eating area.\nLegistar 87464: 1241 Moorland Road (District 14): Consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a single-family residence.\nLegistar 87465: 2352 S Park Street (District 14): Consideration of a conditional use in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District for temporary outdoor event to allow a “pop-up” market adjacent to mixed-use building.\nLegistar 87466: 5004 Tradewinds Parkway (District 16): Consideration of a conditional use in the Industrial-Limited (IL) District for indoor recreation to allow spaces in an existing multi-tenant industrial building to be converted into an indoor recreation facility.\nLegistar 87467: 1110 Deming Way/8701 Blackhawk Road: Consideration of a conditional use in the Suburban Employment Center (SEC) District for indoor recreation; consideration of a conditional use in the SEC District for outdoor recreation; consideration of a conditional use in the SEC District for a restaurant-tavern; and consideration of a conditional use in the SEC District for an outdoor eating area open past 9:00 p.m. and with amplified sound, all to allow construction of a 31,000 square-foot indoor recreation facility with restaurant-tavern, outdoor recreation, and an outdoor eating area.\nLegistar 87468: 6501 Kilpatrick Lane (District 16): Consideration of a conditional use in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District for a drive-through window to allow construction of a financial institution (credit union) with a drive-through window.\nLegistar 87472: Approving the final plat of First Addition to Hill Valley on land generally addressed as 1051 S Pleasant View Road and 1050 S High Point Road (District 1).\n\n\n\nElectric Generator for Green Tree Landfill\nItem 11 of the night focused on Legistar 87469: Conditional use in the Conservancy (CN) District to allow for the installation and use of an emergency electric generator at the Greentree Landfill, located at 6802 Hammersley Road in District 20. Staff reviewed the proposal, noting the site is currently supported by one gas generator. The new electric generator is set to be installed on a pad directly next to the current unit, which sits 140 feet from the nearest residence. The emergency generator pad would be roughly five feet closer and is expected to run 20 hours a year total. The run time estimate is based on one hour a month for maintenance on the gas generator (twelve hours total) and power outages that would stop the existing unit’s pump and halt operation (expected eight hours a year, but would be weather dependent).\nJay McLellan, a district resident, voiced concern over the need for the generator and their confusion surrounding communications sent out by City Engineering. McLellan stated they received a postcard last week with notice of tonight’s meeting, but no information on why an additional generator was slated to be installed at the landfill. This was concerning, as the location has a history of danger, with McLellan referencing the explosion of a home on Hammersley Road in the 1980’s as a result of gasses escaping the landfill. They had no issues with views or noise that would be caused by the new unit, but rather safety and how the need was assessed.\nJack Brody, present to answer questions on behalf of the City’s Engineering division, was unable to answer Alder Harrington-McKinny’s follow-up inquiry on improving communications with residents; however, Brody gave further insight to the need for the generator. Going off of Alder Guequierre’s questioning of current City protocol, Brody confirmed the City dispatches mobile generators when needed. This can be problematic, as there are only two units available, which other entities such as the Madison Fire Department often request to use. Shared use is in addition to generators needing to be transported by staff, which can be difficult during flooding and winter storms. Brody acknowledged the safety concerns, and highlighted the Greentree Landfill as having the highest potential for explosion—furthering the need for the electric back-up. Currently, the City will not allow the generator to be down more than four hours at a time due to gas build-up and potential leaks. In the event of an outage, the landfill can be allowed to sit without a running generator for up to 24 hours before becoming a major safety concern, although letting it sit that long is not ideal. Brody clarified the generator would come out of Engineering’s budget, not the City’s.\nThe item passed with unanimous approval from the plan commission.\n\n\nPark-and-Ride Lot for the University of Wisconsin-Madison\nLegistar 87471 and 87475 both concerned additional parking for UW—the former being for conditional use in an Industrial-Limited (IL) District and the later for approving a certified survey map of a property owned by Madison Square Storage, LLC. in order to make way for a parking lot located at 2230 Pennsylvania Avenue in District 12.\nCommissioner Mendez recused themselves from voting, as their employment with the University is ties directly to this project. Alder Field and Commissioner McCahill also disclosed their employment with UW-Madison, but stated it would not impact their votes.\nStaff once again presented, going over the proposed use for the lot. UW offers park and ride options for employees Monday through Friday, with charter buses running every 20 minutes during peak times and every 30 minutes during off-peak hours. The current plan would be to extend this option to the public on specific weekends for high-traffic events that expect to fill current parking allowances. The proposal includes 229 parking spaces, two motorcycle spots, and several bike slots for cyclists. Overall, Staff recommended approving the plan as they do not believe it will inhibit further development.\nWilliam Butcher, representing the developer working with the University to establish the park and ride, was questioned by the Commission on the plan’s inclusion of four electric vehicle spaces. Butcher acknowledged this is the minimum set forth by the City; however, they are currently reworking the plan to increase that number to 20–possibly 23. Butcher says they are more than amenable to exceeding the four spots, it is simply a matter of input and electrical planning. Butcher also took a moment to highlight how the proposal would help alleviate traffic congestion and automobile emissions, all while increasing parking availability downtown due to less use by employees and visitors to the University.\nDiscussion emerged surrounding how UW decided on the location in question, to which Butcher did not know the specifics. He was able to say he understood UW had done their due diligence, taking into consideration access to public transit, commute time from the lot to campus, and the location falling outside of the primary downtown areas with the highest need for additional housing. Aside from those items, he could not say why or how the University settled on this particular site. Butcher added that several neighborhood associations in the area had been contacted, as well as district Alder Latimer Burris, and based on responses their was no need to hold a public hearing regarding the proposed development.\nCommissioner Heck specifically asked if this would be a free or paid parking option. Butcher, being with the developer and not UW Transportation, did not know. Commissioner Mendez did not contribute to the conversation or provide additional information regarding UW-Madison’s planned use of the lot, despite being the Director of Transportation Operations.\nThis author examined the issue and found there are no free parking options available to University employees. Other park and ride options are available but require a permit can be seen on the UW Transportation website for anyone interested in a more comprehensive answer on expected fees associated with using the lot. Commissioner Heck further questioned why the model is not closer to what we have seen for EPIC employees, with further lots from EPIC’s campus and a central drop-off location. While Butcher is not aware of the logistics, Transportation’s website also shows multiple stops on campus which get employees closer to their office location.\nStemming from questioning from Commissioners McCahill and Heck, Butcher did disclose the University is placing pressure on the developer to have the project complete by the end of the Summer, likely for the start of the Fall semester and football season, and that the lease would be for 15 years. Commissioner Heck asked staff if they were allowed to limit the conditional use to five years and reassess at a later date based on housing needs, which staff responded yes. This prompted Commissioner Wasniewski to ask staff if this proposal fit into the City Plan. Staff drew attention to the location’s current zoning as being industrial and containing a generous amount of warehouses. As such, staff believe it conforms to the current City Plan.\nWhile Commissioners Heck and McCahill did so begrudgingly—finding it difficult to approve a parking lot instead of housing—the items both passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nExisting UW-Madison park and ride nearby that the proposed parking lot will replace\n\n\n\n\n\nUW-Madison private bus service information\n\n\n\n\nSecretary’s Report\nSecretary Tuttle corrected a statement from the March 17th, clarifying tonight’s meeting was the final for current sitting Alders, not March 17th. Although Wisconsin just held an election April 1st, which included the Alder race on Madison ballots, the newly elected alders have yet to be sworn in and assigned to their respective committees. Tuttle once again thanked everyone for their participation, preparation, and contributions as members of the Plan Commission.\nTuttle also drew attention to several development highlights from this past year, including the approval of just over three thousand multi family homes, 161 new single family homes, and 134 lots for two-family residences. This is in addition to approving over 700 preliminary lots for further housing developments. While this is a decline from previous years, it is similar to numbers seen in 2021 and the Plan Commission continues to see a promising, steady stream of applications to further housing, plats, and conditional use within the City of Madison.\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\nThe March 17th, 2025 Plan Commission Meeting was short and sweet, with most of the items being passed or placed on file without prejudice as part of this week’s consent agenda. Although Alder Field, along with Commissioners McCahill and Mendez, disclosed their affiliation with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Commissioner Mendez was the only member to abstain from voting on the 210 Bernard Court demolition, as Mendez has direct involvement with the project. Alder Field and Commissioner McCahill stated for the record they are not involved in the request and their employment status at the University would not impact their votes.\nThe consent agenda consisted of six items total, three of which were passed unanimously and three of which were placed on file without prejudice.\n\nItems Passed Unanimously:\n\nConsideration of a demolition permit to demolish a three-family residence at 210 Bernard Court in District 8 Legistar 87142.\nConsideration of a demolition permit to demolish a financial institution located at 6702 Odana Road in District 19 Legistar 87140.\nConditional use at 6702 Odana Road in District 19 in a Commercial Center (CC) District for dwelling units in a four-story mixed-use building with approximately 1,973 square feet of commercial space and 60 apartments Legistar 87141.\n\n\n\nItems Placed on File without Prejudice:\n\n[Placed on file due to being withdrawn:] consideration of conditional use in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District to convert a restaurant-tavern to a restaurant-nightclub located at 1025 N Sherman Avenue in District 12 Legistar 87144.\n[Developer has withdrawn demolition application:] consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a mixed-use building, including an apartment and restaurant located at 77 Sirloin Strip in District 14 Legistar 86732.\n[Proposed conditional use cannot proceed due to demolition application being withdrawn:] Consideration for conditional use in the [proposed] Traditional Residential-Urban 1 (TR-U1) District for a multi-family dwelling with greater than 60 units to allow for construction of a 74-unit apartment building located at 77 Sirloin Strip in District 14 Legistar 86733.\n\n\n\nJay’s, 406 North Frances Street, Conditional Use\nLegistar 87143\nThe only item up for discussion was consideration for conditional use in an Urban Mixed-Use (UMX) District for a nightclub at Jay’s in District 2, located at 406 North Frances Street. Staff Chris Wells presented, reviewing the applicant’s request for approval to operate the proposed nightclub out of an existing tavern. The owner, Jay Wanserski, joined the public hearing via telephone to gain clarity on the closed doors condition and how that impacted the ability for their establishment to utilize garage doors that open sections of the building wall to allow for additional airflow in the warmer months. The public hearing initially closed following Wanserski’s speaking time allotment; however, Commissioner Heck asked staff if the Plan Commission had authority over conditions set in the approval. Staff confirmed the commission could alter conditions, citing the 2022 approval for Red Rock Saloon’s application with a condition allowing Red Rock to keep their similarly styled garage doors open until midnight. In order to gain a better understanding of the owner’s plans for operating the night club, a movement was made to reopen the public hearing.\nCommissioner Heck led the discussion with Wanserski, clarifying that live music would end before midnight or the garage doors must be shut. It was agreed Jay’s may keep their garage doors open when music is coming from their jukebox, with Wanserski noting that most performers end their sets before midnight. Wanserski further noted any music played from the jukebox after midnight is typically quieter due to fewer patrons filtering in and out during the hours leading up to bar time. Ultimately, Commissioner Heck moved to amend the conditions to meet Wanserski’s request and the change passed. This was immediately followed by the Plan Commission’s approval of the application for conditional use.\n\n\nClosing Remarks\nClosing out the meeting, Secretary Tuttle mentioned a three week break in meetings and heavier agendas coming next month due to the April 1st election and Alder turnover. Along with providing updates regarding 77 Sirloin Strip from the Common Council Meeting, Secretary Tuttle also noted the Lamp House substitute was adopted by the Madison Alders. The Commission adjourned, with the next meeting scheduled for Monday, April 7th.\n\n\n\nMarch 3, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nThe March 3, 2025 Plan Commission Meeting discussed the following actions:\n\nRecommended that Council deny a rezoning request for a 74 unit apartment development at 77 Sirloin Strip be denied.\nRecommend that Council amend the Lamp House Report to make it clear that did not adopt its recommended changes to height restrictions around the Lamp House.\nApproved conditional use for a drive-through coffee shop in a TOD overlay district at 3915 Lien Road.\nApproved demolition single-family homes and recommended rezoning around 922 Fair Oaks, 3222 East Washington for future multi-family.\nRecommended Council reject rezoning and preliminary plat for new Leo Living subdivision at 6303 Portage Road.\n\nBefore diving in to their key items, the Commission referred discussion of conditional use at 3915 Lien Road in District 3, in which a dive through window for a coffee shop is being requested (Legistar 86523). Additionally, the Committee unanimously passed their consent agenda, which included:\n\nConsent Agenda\n\nCreating Chapter 21 of the Madison General Ordinances related to Zoning Floodplain Regulations and Maps (Legistar 86804)\nAmending various sections within Chapter 28 of the Madison General Ordinances to remove floodplain references (Legistar 86807) Creating Section 28.022-00703 of the Madison General Ordinances to change the zoning of property located at 321 Russell Street from PD (Planned Development) District to TSS (Traditional Shopping Street) District. (District 6) (Legistar 86989)\n623 N Lake Street (District 2): Consideration of a conditional use in the Downtown Residential 2 (DR2) District for a multi-family dwelling with greater than eight (8) dwelling units, and consideration of a conditional use in the DR2 District for a lodging house, all to allow alterations to an approved eight-story mixed-use building to contain 21 apartments and a ten-room lodging house. (Legistar 86728)\n1240 Sherman Avenue (District 6): Consideration of a conditional use to allow construction of two accessory buildings on a lakefront parcel (Legistar 86857).\nAdjacent to 3111 Burke Road, Town of Sun Prairie: Consideration of a Certified Survey Map within the City’s Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to create one residential lot (Legistar 86860).\n\n\n\n77 Sirloin Strip Development\n\nDemoltion, Legistar 86732\nConditional Use, Legistar 86733\nZoning, Legistar 86990\n\nA new development proposal has been submitted for 77 sirloin strip in district 14 on Madison’s south side. The application covers demolition (legislar 86732), rezoning from Traditional Residential- Varied 2 to Traditional Residential- Urban 1 (TR-V2 to TR-U1 under Legistar 86990), and consideration of conditional use in a TR-U1 zone for a multi-family dwelling to allow for a 74 unit, 55+ Senior Living apartment building (Legistar 86733).\nCity Staff Tim Parks presented, covering a plan proposed by Imminent Development Corp. and Sketchworks Architecture that would replace the existing building currently housing Pollo Rumbero and previously Hooka Lounge. Parks highlighted the proposal and the applicants’ desire to measure building height based on an exhausting rock shelf that covers the site, why the conditional use would be needed due to the number of planned units, and how the building height will need further conditional use allowances due to the current design coming to a total of six stories—two partially exposed levels below four stories of residences.\nThe owner of Pollo Rumbero, Araceli Rivera, spoke during the public meeting, voicing concerns over the termination of her current lease and having received no communication from the developer, only a notice from the current building owner. Rivera noted how not only would relocation cause hardship for their business, but would also impact their community outreach. Currently, Pollo Rumbero offers community space to the neighboring trailer park and overflow parking, in addition to opening their doors as a storm shelter when the weather makes the trailer park unsafe. Additionally, Rivera emphasized their initiatives in feeding the homeless and their educational outreach. Pollo Rumbero offers scholarships to students attending college and regularly donates to local high schools to help students in need.\nJulian Walters, a representative from Imminent Development assured the Commission their company had done its due diligence by holding a community meeting to discuss concerns with local residents; however, only “about 3 to 5 people” attended. Although it is unclear if meeting announcements were also posted/provided in Spanish, Walter’s stated a translator was available had Rivera attended the meeting. Walters further claimed Imminent Development was willing to work with Sketchworks and Pollo Rumbero on potentially leasing out a portion of the new building to house the restaurant, as well as incorporate plans for shared community’s spaces and shelters that would be available to the neighboring mobile home residents.\nThe situation gave the Commission pause, as Commissioner Solheim draw attention to how the plans provided with the application do not include some of the spaces Walters mentioned, in addition to Staff’s concerns over the height of the building and construction in an area of Madison which is already getting a considerable facelift as part of the 2025 Comprehensive Plan. While Commissioner Heck was concerned over WHEDA’s cyclical funding, the Commission ultimately placed all three items on file as the plans seemed “half-baked.” The items will be revisited at the March 17th, 2025 meeting to allow Imminent Development and Sketchworks to create a more holistic plan before the Commission makes a decision.\n\n\nAmending The Lamp House Report\nLegistar 86824\nThe commission moved on to discuss a potential Amendment to the Report of the Lamp House Block Ad Hoc Plan. Previously, the report cited concerns over further developing the Lamp House, as it is listed on the National Register for Historic Places due to having been designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The report called for the maintenance of several lines of sight both to the Lamp House from the street and from the Lamp House out to Lake Mendota. This is in conflict with the 6 story height limits in the surrounding areas. In 2021, Council considered whether to officially alter nearby height limits to match what was requested in the Lamp House report, but rejected the idea. Nonetheless, staff consider the Lamp House report to be a part of city plans, and so will not allow development that conflicts with it.\nAlder Bennett proposed an amendment to the Lamp House report to eliminate recommendations to preserve views that limit development opportunities. This was met with criticism at Landmarks Commission, who in particular were concerned that editing the report itself disrespected the integrity of the original recommendations. Alder Field proposed a substitute ammendment that would place an adendem at the end of the Lamp House report stating that Council chose not to change height limits in response to the report. This is intended to end the conflict between city plans and the Lamp House report that has prevented development.\nBruce Bosben, who currently owns the Lamp House, has previously applied to further develop the building while preserving the design while adding residential space above the existing structure in order to meet the city’s current housing needs in the downtown area. Bosben has no desire to demolish the building, but notes that it is currently not sustainable as a stand-alone tourist attraction, even with its status as a Frank Lloyd Wright structure. As part of his venture, which began in 2014, Bosben has been in contact with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy in Chicago. According to the Chicago office, there is no reason not to add residential space above the Lamp House, so long as the integrity and as much of the original architecture as possible is preserved.\nWhile Bosben aims to maintain the property and keep it true to its original architecture, aside from the proposed additions, the Madison Historical Trust is highly against further development. Opponents such as Jack Holzhueter went as far as to request a vote be passed “to put [the proposal] on file with prejudice [because] this is a self-serving act on the part of individuals.” This led Alder Bennett to further inquire into Bosben’s conversations with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy. Bosben reiterated the Conservancy feels they “must advocate for the protection of Wright resources;” however, they are in favor of the project because it would allow for redevelopment while placing Wright’s work as a key, functioning competent in the new structure. Bosben clarified the Lamp House is not falling apart, taking credit for being a “good custodian” despite how harsh student renters can be on this and similar properties he owns, and stated he did not want this to be a fight with the City, but would like to find some sort of middle ground in order to help address the housing crisis.\n\n\nLein Road Coffee Shop\nLegistar 86523\nFurther discussion occurred regarding the Consideration of a conditional use in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay District for a drive-through window to allow construction a coffee shop with drive-through window (legistar 86523). The proposed coffee shop, which would be located at 3915 Lien Road in District 3, aims to offer two drive through lanes, as well as a walk-up window option for pedestrians. City Staff believe the conditional use conditions have been met, as there is ample, safe space for pedestrian use and cyclists would be able to use the lanes just as a vehicle would. The only notable concerns brought to the commission were grading surrounding the build site, as the flat is lower than the neighboring streets of East Washington Avenue and Lein Road.\nSubsequently, Alder Field requested more information regarding accessibility. Malena Olivera, a representative in attendance on behalf of the developers, Plaza Street Partners, provided clarification on how they are currently looking to how to add additional access points that will be both handi-capable and ADA compliant, depending on how many they can add and where they will be able to get approval for the access points’ locations while taking into consideration the grade and safety of existing retaining walls. Alder Field also inquired as to whether or not the Plan Commission could request additional signage requirements in order to make access points easier to locate and navigate. City Staff member Parks clarified they cannot control signage, but they could advise and/or advocate for additional postings. Field made a motion to request language on signage to be added, to which Commissioner Tuttle weighed in and the Plan Commission was agreeable with. Ultimately, the request was approved before moving on to the next topic of the evening.\n\n\nDemolitions and rezoning around 922 Fair Oaks, 3222 East Washington\n\nDemolition 922-926 N Fair Oaks Legistar 86734\nRezoning 922-926 N Fair Oaks Legistar 86991\nDemolition 3222-3238 East Washington Legistar 86735\nRezoning 3222-3238 East Washington Legistar 86992\n\nThe Commission quickly reviewed demolition and future use for two locations. The first parcel, located at 922-926 N Fair Oaks Avenue in District 12, included Legistars 86734 and 86991. Consideration calls for the demolition of two single-family homes and rezoning from a TR-C1 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 1) District to a CC-T (Commercial Corridor-Transitional) District. The second concerned 3222, 3230, and 3238 E Washington Avenue, also in District 12, regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish three single-family residences.This is in conjunction with legistar 86992, which changes the zoning of property located at 3222-3238 East Washington Avenue and 3229 Ridgeway Avenue from a TR-C1 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 1) district and a TR-C4 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 4) district to TR-U2 (Traditional Residential-Urban 2) district. All four items passed, allowing for further development to take place within District 12. These changes make way for two future apartment developments.\n\n\nLEO Living Subdivision Plat at 6303 Portage Road\n\nRezoning Legistar 86993\nPreliminary Plat Legistar 86736\n\nThe final item of the night included legistars 86993 and 86736, which focus on development proposals at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road in District 17. The first component was comprised of changing the zoning of the property located at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road from a Temp. A (Temporary Agricultural) District to an A (Agricultural) District, as well as changing the zoning of the property located at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road from a Temp. A (Temporary Agricultural) District to a TR-P (Traditional Residential-Planned) District. The second consisted of approving the preliminary plat of the LEO Living on property addressed as 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road.\nStaff immediately proposed denying the requests, stating they do not believe the proposal fits their city plans for the site due topographical concerns within the 6303 parcel. Namely, the intermittent stream located on the property and floodplains and other topographical issues led city plans (Pumpkin Hollow Neighborhood Plan and Rattman Neighborhood Plan) to not call for housing on the developed portion of the land. Due to this, Staff referenced the likelihood of future structural issues due to erosion, even with the plan’s inclusion of retaining walls.\nJoann Rubio, a member of the development team proposing future housing on the parcels, stated they believe their team would be meeting the Pumpkin Hollow development objectives by constructing a mixed-use building which would be available to families, seniors, and community resources. Rubio further argued the Department of Natural Resources does not include the intermittent stream in their 1988 assessment as an environmental corridor—noting the DNR has not issue with the proposed building plans so long as the developer recognizes and utilized the natural drain-off. Rubio also mentioned retaining walls were only included in the proposal due to the developer’s haste in getting their paperwork submitted to the City, but that they were open to modifications and suggestions on how to best address both the flood plains and grading of the parcels. Commissioner Solheim asked Staff Tim Parks to review the DNR’s assessment, to which Parks responded, noting the City is aware of the stream’s impact on the parcel. Parks emphasized its importance, noting is is protected by both “law and environmental ethos,” and clarifying its not being included in the DNR’s assessment does not negate its importance to local waterways. According to City records and the Staff report, the intermittent stream begins on the property before joining other tributaries that ultimately flow into Starkwater Creek.\nSolheim moved to put the rezoning request on file without prejudice due to inconsistencies with Rattman’s and Pumpkin Hollow’s development objectives, as well as zoning incompatibility/failure to meet future use requirements and was passed by the Plan Commission. Solheim then moved to deny the approval of the preliminary plat due to concerns over stormwater and street recommendations. The Commission agreed and legistar 86736 was denied before the meeting adjourned.\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nOfficial Minutes\n\nConsent Agenda\n\nTriangle Plat (District 13) Recommended to Council Vacating and discontinuing portions of Braxton place to allow replatting for parts of Lots 1 and 2 (Legistar 86814).\nBig Sky Drive (District 9) Approved of conditional use for an autobody shop (Legistar 86522)\n5001, 5005, & 5013 Femrite Drive (District 16) Approved demolishion of a storage building and two single family residences (Legistar 86521)\n\n\n\n2025 Progress Update - City of Madison Comprehensive Plan\nLegistar 86656\nCity Staff members Brian Grady and Breana Collins reviewed the new comprehensive plan, spotlighting some of the City’s most ambitious goals and important objectives. Grady emphasized how the plan is used to help guide the City’s budget and planning requests, adding the plan is also important for private sector planning regarding framework, growth, and future land use.\nThis year’s plan is made up of 7 elements, which include 14 goals, 59 strategies, and 209 actions for implementation. After receiving feedback from roughly 15,000 community members, affordable housing and Madison’s very own BRT have once again been noted as the city’s hottest topics.\nThe plan includes its own Neighborhood and Housing element, which Collin’s drew much attention to. Noteworthy items included the rehabilitation of the Tree Lane public housing units, the addition of 639 housing units throughout Madison, and redevelopment at the Triangle—primarily, the replacement of old public housing with mixed income apartments and complexes such as Bayview, revamping their properties to include more colorful and vibrant housing. Secretary Tuttle later commented on the City’s approval of over 5,600 permits for new homes between 2023 and 2024–commending the Plan Commission for its involvement in the approval of many of those requests and aiding in the City’s housing development efforts.\n\n\n\nPlanning Process\n\n\nMadison Metro’s BRT is once again on everyone’s mind, as the City strives to keep improving the newly introduced system. Collins focused on the Comprehensive Plan’s use of federal funds to aid in the procurement of larger buses and the City’s implementation of a new fare system, citing the BRT as being the backbone of Madison’s public transportation due to its “Point A to Point B design.” Towards the end of the meeting, Commissioner Heck requested additional details regarding Strategy 7.D, (“Develop and implement a park-and-ride plan to increase accessibility to downtown and the UW–Madison campus.”). City staff responded by noting how other communities with public transportation tend to have more park and ride options with larger lots in addition to greater access with less restrictive routes. If the City is able to implement the plan successfully, public transportation will be available to a larger part of the Madison Metropolitan population, effectively decreasing automobile traffic and congestion in the downtown area while creating safer spaces for pedestrians and cyclists.\nMadison’s public spaces also gained an honorable mention at Tuesday’s meeting. The Commission drew further attention to accessible playgrounds being installed at both Rennebohm and Elver Park on Madison’s east and west sides, respectively, both of which boast inclusive features such as braille on their equipment. There was also discussion surrounding the intention to redesign a stretch of John Nolen Drive’s lakefront with the upcoming Lake Monona Waterfront Master Plan. Changes are expected to take decades; however, the city aims to have more usable public space in addition to its mission to expand safe cyclist and pedestrian routes while improving driveability. This led into a later discussion on State Street’s current battle between bikers and pedestrians now that it is a designated pedestrian area with limited auto access. Secretary Tuttle admitted prior to the Comprehensive Plan the city should have done more testing to better understand the transition, an error which has ultimately caused people to disregard cyclists and call into question who has the right-of-way when using the pedestrian zone.\nHeck also the City of Madison plans to address the new Comprehensive Plan planning process in 2028, inquiring as to whether the plan will be based off of the 2025 proposal or if the City will start from scratch. Staff responded this will likely be dependent on several factors and the efficacy of their 2025 Comprehensive plan, which they expect to begin evaluating some time in late 2025 or 2026\nCommissioner Solheim requested clarification on how the City anticipates advertising the 2025 Comprehensive Plan update and getting the word out. Grady mentioned the availability of Plan materials in several languages, including Spanish and Hmong, as well as an upcoming press release to gain more media coverage. Secretary Tuttle also encouraged Madisonians to spread awareness, either by word of mouth or by sending information to businesses, boards, and community members who may find it of interest.\n\n\n\nJanuary 13, 2025\nBy Tori Cooper\nAlso live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ\nOfficial Minutes\nTuesday night’s Plan Commission Committee Meeting ran almost two and a half hours—primarily focusing on two key items:\n\nConditional use for the Essen Haus to expand its hours of outside operation.\nThe proposed demolition of two homes in the Wingra Neighborhood, with plans to build one single-family residence in their place.\n\nBefore diving into the issues, the committee voted to unanimously pass consent items such as:\n\nConsent Agenda\n\nRecommended to Council Rezoning at 709 Northport Drive in District 18 from SR-01 to TR-U1 (Legistar 83924).\nConditional use at 908 E. Main Street in District 6 for a beauty school in a multi-use complex (Legistar 86416).\nPermit an accessory building on a lake-front property at 913 Woodward Drive in District 18 (Legistar 86418).\nPermission to eliminate a facade (demolition) on a street-facing, single-family residence located at 2449 Fox Avenue in District 13 (Legistar 86420).\nRecommend to Council to approve certified survery map for a residential lot at 4952 Thorston Road in Sun Prairie in order to begin plans for two multi-family complexes (Legistar 86421).\n\n\n\nEssen Haus, 506-518 E Wilson Street, Conditional Use\nLegistar 86417\nPrior to re-zoning from PD to UMX, Essen Haus operated later into the evening and ran their Volleyball league two hours past the allowed hours stipulated by their approvals. Last year Plan Commission gave them conditional use approval for these outside events, but for an earlier end time, including for Volleyball. This application includes requests for live music events, later volleyball league end times, use of an outdoor eating patio, and later closing time requirements. Essen Haus and Come Back In owner, Robert Worm, spoke to the committee regarding the benefits of expanding events and hours at Essen Haus, arguing later hours made for a more active neighborhood. In his argument, which was echoed by some other members or the public, Worm referenced a decline in undesirable behavior. The previous red-light take-over of the area in the ’70s and ’80s declined, and “vice type” behavior prevalent in the ’90s faded out as the Essen Haus and Come Back In supported a more active nightlife in the area; however, neighbors in the area were not enthusiastic about the proposed changes to the agreement. Bob J. and Stephen O’Neal, two nearby residents, argued against Worm’s appeal, both citing the noise as a primary reason for their concerns. While O’Neal made it clear he is not opposed to the activities themselves, the concern lies in disturbing what has become a dense residential neighborhood. Worm blames the disagreement on the change in management and residents in the condo he built in 1985 and later sold. Plan Commission ultimately allowed conditional use for later Volleyball hours in a unanimous vote; however, the approval was contingent on the operating under the similar conditions as the 2024 approval, meaning continuing to end serving at 9pm, limiting special live music events to two instead of three, and having doors to the patio area remain closed to prevent excess noise.\n\n\n1007 Edgewood Ave., Demolition\nLegistar 86419\nThe Committee also addressed reapplication to demolish two adjacent single-family homes on a single lot in the Wingra neighborhood. While the intended use for the lot is to create one, single-family residence, City Staff member Megan Tuttle noted that the intended use could not be considered as part of the proposal. John Collins, who holds the homes under Edgewood Park LLC., was represented at the meeting by Chris Nelson and Robert Procter. Nelson and Proctor argued the home should not be considered historical due to ‘unsympathetic alterations,’ which include the addition of vinyl siding on both homes and vinyl windows at 1007 Edgewood Ave. Several residents, some of which have experience rehabbing historical homes or with their certification, raised the question of the original wood siding being hidden underneath the vinyl. Bonnie Gruber, who shared a similar argument as other speakers in opposition of the demolition, stated a single residence replacing the two goes against Madison’s housing initiatives. Further stating each property should remain “a simple home for ordinary people and Madison cares about ordinary people.” Bob Klebba, expanded on Gruber’s statement, saying the reports submitted to the city supporting demolition read more like realtor’s evaluations—highlighting the applicants’ lack of official reports from the fire department, city, or similar certified entities. Ultimately, the demolition was denied by the committee for a second time, despite the attendance of attorneys representing John Collin’s and Edgewood Park, LLC.\n\n\n6201 Old Middleton Rd., Certified Survey Map\nLegistar 86415\nAfter spending over an hour hearing speakers in support and opposition of the demolition application, the committee wrapped up their meeting with a brief review and vote towards approving an official survey map for a parcel located at 6201 Old Middleton Road on Madison’s west side. While questions were raised about the accuracy of an aerial survey that had been conducted, City staff Chris Wells confirmed the discrepancy, noting that aerial surveys are often only estimates whereas physical surveys yield actual square footage of the area in question. The intended use for the lot(s) in question would include one or multiple deep end residences. The movement for an official survey passed unanimously, and intended use will be determined at a later time, pending the survey’s findings."

    "text": "Methodology\n\nYIMBY Score\nThe “YIMBY” (“Yes in my backyard”) voting scale is intended to be an objective measure of the pro-housing alignment of Madison Common Council Members. However, you should be highly skeptical of any measure that purports to be “objective,” because every measurement of attitudes requires some value judgements. Our measure is no different! When evaluating a vote we employ maximalist YIMBY criteria, even though this is not necessarily how we would vote and is not the view of any particular pro-housing advocates or organization. But it provides a useful reference point. The standard holds that housing developments should always be approved if they meet minimal standards for safety and functionality; zoning that prevents the most housing possible from being built should be eliminated; transportation policy should promote car-free living (or at least the ability to live without a car). All alder votes relevant to YIMBY issues are weighted equally, with votes on particular amendments or motions of an item averaged together so that an item doesn’t get more weight because it had multiple votes for amendments, etc.\nDo you think this is a misguided approach? Please send us an email and let us know why we are wrong. Also please let us know if you think we are missing votes or have made a mistake."

    "text": "Methodology\n\nYIMBY Score\nThe “YIMBY” (“Yes in my backyard”) voting scale is intended to be an objective measure of the pro-housing alignment of Madison Common Council Members. However, you should be highly skeptical of any measure that purports to be “objective,” because every scale of attitudes requires some value judgement. Our measure is no different! When evaluating a vote we employ maximalist YIMBY criteria, even though this is not necessarily how we would vote and is not the view of any particular pro-housing advocates or organization. But it provides a useful reference point. The standard holds that housing developments should always be approved if they meet minimal standards for safety and functionality; zoning that prevents the most housing possible from being built should be eliminated; transportation policy should promote car-free living (or at least the ability to live without a car). All alder votes relevant to YIMBY issues are weighted equally, with votes on particular amendments or motions of an item averaged together so that an item doesn’t get more weight because it had multiple votes for amendments, etc.\nDo you think this is a misguided approach? Please send us an email and let us know why we are wrong. Also please let us know if you think we are missing votes or have made a mistake."

His concern is with Legistar 90552. He states that on October 28, 2025, the Common Council referred the proposal to both the Housing Policy Committee and Plan Commission for comment and doesn’t believe the proposal has been referred to the Landmarks Commission.\nThere were no disclosures or recusals.\nThe following items were moved to the Consent Agenda with a finding of (C) no known historical value:\n\nItem #3: Request for Certificate of Approval regarding exterior alteration of signage in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District for a property located at 308 S. Paterson St. in District 6 Legistar 90440.\nItem #4: Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a commercial building located at 501 N. Whitney Way in District 11 Legistar 90454.\nItem #5: Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a single-family residential building located at 3009 Stevens St. in District 5 Legistar 90460.\nItem #6: Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a commercial building located at 425 N. Frances St. in District 2 Legistar 90465.\n\nAlder Duncan moved to approve with a second by Commissioner Harris. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n308 S.

Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a commercial building (District 11).\n\n\n\nThe commercial building at 501 N. Whitney Way\n\n\n\n\n3009 Stevens St. — Demolition Historic Value Review\nLegistar 90460. Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a single-family residential building (District 5).\n\n\n\nThe single-family home at 3009 Stevens St.\n\n\n\n\n425 N.

Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a commercial building (District 2).\n\n\n\nThe commercial building at 425 N. Frances St.\n\n\n\n\n425 N. Frances St. and 450 W. Gilman St. — Advisory Recommendation\nLegistar 90011. Advisory Recommendation regarding development adjacent to a designated Madison Landmark (Grimm Book Bindery at 454 W. Gilman St.) (District 2).\nThis project was brought before the Landmarks Commission on September 15, 2025, where the builder received recommendations on how best to decrease the overall massing of the new 16-story affordable student housing building being constructed next door to the Grimm Book Bindery landmark.\nThree people were registered to speak: Brian Munson and Bobby Tait, registering in support and wishing to speak, and Rebecca Anderson, registering in opposition and wishing to speak.\nBrian Munson and Bobby Tait, representing the applicant, reviewed the changes since the meeting in September. They highlighted changes regarding the size of the pool so it did not go over the property line, the additional step back to reduce the massing, and the break between the Grimm Book Bindery and the new construction to create separation. They are also willing to work on the garage door, making it look less industrial and more consistent with the rest of the building.\nRebecca Anderson, owner of the Grimm Book Bindery, expressed concern that the new construction would limit natural light into the Bindery and that this would deteriorate the Bindery. She was also concerned about the amount of traffic this development would cause.\nCommissioner Ely-Ledesma asked if there were windows on the Bindery that faced the new construction. Brian Munson stated yes and that this is where they pulled the building back to allow for the windows. Commissioners Kaliszewski and Arnesen stated they appreciated the changes and thought it made the project look much better.\nA motion was made by Commissioner Arnesen, seconded by Commissioner Harris, to advise the Plan Commission and Urban Design Commission that because of these changes, the project will not be so large as to adversely affect the historic character and integrity of the adjoining landmark; however, they recommend a less industrial look for the garage to maintain the integrity of the adjacent landmark. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nThe current industrial-style garage door design; a less industrial appearance was recommended\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering of the proposed development showing the setback and separation between the Grimm Book Bindery (left) and the new 16-story building\n\n\n\n\n450 W. Gilman St. — Demolition Historic Value Review\nLegistar 90470. Demolition Historic Value Review regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish a commercial building (District 2).\nThe staff report indicates there is no preservation on file; however, the building was built around 1890 as the University Hotel. The architect is unknown, and the building is not architecturally significant. Staff recommended a finding of (C) no known historic value.\nBrian Munson is registered in support of demolition.\nJohn Rolling was not present for the meeting but sent an email requesting a designation of (B), stating that the building has historic value related to the vernacular context. In the email, he provided additional information about what was happening in Madison at the time this building was in use as a university hotel. He believes it will be demolished but that it is a regrettable loss and should be remembered through photographs and measurements.\nCommissioner Harris agreed that the building is a regrettable loss with historic value related to the vernacular context and one that has maintained its integrity, but there is little information about the building itself.\nAlder Duncan said he agreed with staff’s recommendation of (C) no known historic value, while Commissioner Arnesen argued that it is an intact building from 1890, so it’s hard to say it doesn’t have historic value, and was in favor of a (B) finding.\nA motion was made by Alder Duncan to recommend a finding of (C) no known historic value. There was no second, and the motion did not move forward.\nA motion was made by Commissioner Arnesen and seconded by Commissioner Harris to recommend a finding of (B), as the building has historic value related to the vernacular context of Madison’s built environment as an intact building constructed c. 1890, but the building itself is not historically, architecturally, or culturally significant. The motion does not include Mr. Rolling’s recommendation to document the building.\nThe motion passed by the following vote:\nAyes: 3 — Commissioners Harris, Ely-Ledesma, and Arnesen\nNo: 1 — Alder Duncan\nExcused: 2 — Commissioners Morrison and Taylor\nNon-voting: 1 — Commissioner Kaliszewski\n\n\n\nThe building at 450 W. Gilman St., originally constructed c. 1890 as the University Hotel\n\n\n\n\nRegular Business — Secretary’s Report\nLegistar 86033.

This designation recognizes the Butts’ leadership in establishing early African American neighborhoods in Madison. The wording on the plaque was reviewed, and edits were suggested. Alder Duncan made a motion to approve the wording with the recommended edits. Richard Arnesen seconded the motion, and it passed unanimously.\n\n\nDemolition Review - 221 South Baldwin Street\nLegistar 89958 - Demolition Historic Value Review\nThis item opened with a public comment. John Rolling was registered in neither support nor opposition to the demolition but wished to speak. Mr. Rolling suggested that the Landmarks Commission recommend the Plan Commission place a condition on the approval of the demolition requiring that the building be documented through measurements and photographs. He also stated the building is significant because of its designer (Ferdinand Kronenberg) and that it is included on the Williamson Street Walking Tour.\nPreservation Planner Heather Bailey acknowledged that the building is part of the Williamson Street Walking Tour and has some associations with Madison’s history but also stated the building has limited historical integrity. Ms. Bailey referenced photos of the current condition of the building and noted that previous sandblasting treatment caused the sandstone to disintegrate. Additionally, any ornamentation is long gone, and much of the masonry is covered with vinyl siding to conceal the disintegrating sandstone. A motion was made by Jacob Morrison and seconded by Alder Duncan to recommend a finding of no known historic value. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nDemolition Review - 801 South Whitney Way\nLegistar 90161 - Demolition Historic Value Review\nThis item opened with public comments. John Rolling was registered neither in support nor opposition but wished to speak. Mr. Rolling stated this well was one of 11 wells built during the 1920s-1950s that followed the designs from the 1917 central pumping station. Mr. Rolling suggested that the Landmarks Commission recommend the Plan Commission place a condition on the approval of the demolition requiring that the building be documented through measurements and photographs.\nA motion was made by Jacob Morrison and seconded by Richard Arnesen for a finding that this property speaks to the vernacular context of Madison and the evolution of the Prairie-style design for municipal water service structures. They recommended that the Plan Commission request documentation of existing conditions to meet historic survey standards. The motion passed unanimously.\n\nMotion to adjourn was made by Richard Arnesen and seconded by Jacob Morrison. Unanimously approved.\n\n\n\nSeptember 15, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Agenda\nLast month’s minutes were approved. There were no public comments, disclosures, or recusals.\nThe following items were approved on the Consent Agenda with a finding of no known historical value: - Demolition permit for a 4-unit commercial building at 533 Conklin Place (District 2) - Legistar 89670 - Demolition permit for 2 commercial buildings at 305 N. Frances Street (District 2) - Legistar 89675 - Demolition permit for a single-family residence at 6314 Hartford Drive (District 7) - Legistar 89680\nMolly Harris moved to approve, seconded by Jacob Morrison. The motion passed unanimously.\n\nDemolition Review - 533 Conklin Place\nLegistar 89670 - Demolition Historic Value Review for a commercial building at 533 Conklin Place (District 2).\n\n\n\n533 Conklin Place\n\n\n\n\nDemolition Review - 305 N. Frances Street\nLegistar 89675 - Demolition Historic Value Review for 2 commercial buildings at 305 N. Frances Street (District 2).\n\n\n\n305 N. Frances Street\n\n\n\n\nDemolition Review - 6314 Hartford Drive\nLegistar 89680 - Demolition Historic Value Review for a single-family home at 6314 Hartford Drive (District 7).\n\n\n\n6314 Hartford Drive\n\n\n\n\nGarage Demolition - 748 Jenifer Street (Klose Cottage)\nLegistar 89575 - Demolition on a Designated Madison Landmark Site at 748 Jenifer Street in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District, Klose Cottage (District 6).\n\n\n\n748 Jenifer Street\n\n\n\n\n\n748 Jenifer Street\n\n\nThe property contains two buildings: the historic Klose Cottage and a small garage. The garage is not original to the property, is in poor condition, and is not structurally sound. The proposal is to demolish the existing garage and replace it with a new concrete parking slab.\nDuring public comment, Zoe Kuntze (current occupant since 2019) spoke neither in support nor opposition. She expressed concerns about the property owner and management company’s history of negligence, particularly regarding lead paint removal during demolition. She also raised concerns about inadequate parking and potential future decisions by the owner. Heather Bailey noted that the city has issued a work order for the entire property.\nCraig Balbach (representing the owner) and Russ Endres (owner) were registered in support and available for questions. Two letters from neighbors expressed concerns about the demolition’s negative impact on the neighborhood character, where small garages are common.\nCommissioners Harris, Arnesen, Morrison, and Bailey discussed the request and concerns presented. They determined that many concerns fall outside the Landmarks Commission’s jurisdiction and belong to other departments such as Public Health and Zoning.\nJacob Morrison moved to approve the demolition request with conditions that final specifications be approved by staff and that the concrete pad be no larger than the garage footprint. Molly Harris seconded. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\nSignage - Madison Catholic Association Clubhouse\nLegistar 89900 - Certificate of Approval for exterior alteration (signage) to a Designated Madison Landmark, Madison Catholic Association Clubhouse (District 4).\n\n\n\nCurrent signage\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Signage\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent signage\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed signage\n\n\nThe project involves removing existing Hilton signage and replacing it with new ground and canopy signs. None of the existing or proposed signage is located on the historic Madison Catholic Association Clubhouse building. The signage is positioned adjacent to the historic building and on the architectural canopy of the non-historic Hilton hotel located behind the clubhouse.\nMolly Harris moved to approve the Certificate of Approval, seconded by Katherine Kaliszewski. The motion passed unanimously without discussion.\n\n\nInformational Presentation - 425 N. Frances Street and 450 W. Gilman Street\nLegistar 90011 - Development Adjacent to a Designated Madison Landmark (Grimm Book Bindery).\n\n\n\nDrawing of proposed redevelopment adjacent to the historic Grimm Book Bindery at 454 W. Gilman Street\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing of proposed redevelopment adjacent to the historic Grimm Book Bindery at 454 W. Gilman Street\n\n\nBrian Munson and Robert Tait presented early-stage plans for student housing in a 16-story building. The design aims to step down the massing by pushing the building’s bulk toward the rear, preventing the historic building from being overwhelmed.\nKatherine Kaliszewski and Molly Harris expressed concerns that the ground floor alignment might overshadow the historic building. Robert Tait clarified that the footprints are even and other views show this more clearly. Jacob Morrison inquired about materials and colors to minimize massing impact. The team plans to use lighter gray at ground level transitioning to darker colors toward the back.\nAlder Duncan questioned the necessity of a rooftop pool and suggested more sustainable alternatives. Robert Tait acknowledged this could be discussed but noted that pools are important amenities for student housing. Brian Munson explained that most newer downtown student projects include rooftop pools as essential amenities.\nThe project team plans to meet with the Urban Design Commission and hold a neighborhood meeting the following week, with application submission targeted for late October.\n\n\nHistoric Markers - Text Approval\nLegistar 89946 - Historic Markers Text Language Approval\nHeather Bailey explained that the city approved a new historic marker program in 2024. Staff developed language for the first phase of markers and are consulting with tribal partners for Indigenous heritage markers to be presented at a future meeting. Markers will feature brief, accurate text with QR codes linking to additional information that can be updated as needed.\nOUTDOOR MARKET\nPotential location: E. Washington and N.

The motion passed unanimously.\nJacob Morrison moved to adjourn, seconded by Molly Harris. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nAugust 18, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nThe meeting began with the election of officers.

Gorham Street in the Mansion Hill Historic District (District 2).\nThis project appeared before the Landmarks Commission for the third time, following previous presentations in March and May 2025. The proposal involves combining lots at 116 and 124 E. Gorham Street, constructing a new multi-unit building at 124 E. Gorham, and relocating and renovating an existing historic carriage house.\nStaff found that the latest design harmonizes with historic structures in the area and that the building’s massing has been appropriately reduced through setbacks and other design features. Staff recommended approval with conditions requiring: - Final specifications for proposed windows, doors, railings, siding, fascia, roof venting, lighting, and mechanicals - A plan for the temporary removal and reinstallation of the historic carriage house\n\n\n\nCurrent view of 124 E.

Washington Avenue\nLegistar 89434 - Demolition Historic Value Review for a commercial building at 302 E. Washington Avenue (District 2).\n\n\n\nCommercial building at 302 E. Washington Avenue, former Capitol Times building\n\n\nJohn Rolling spoke in opposition to the demolition, noting that the building housed the Capitol Times from 1928 to 1949. He expressed concern about losing history and requested that if demolition is approved, photos and measured drawings be taken and preserved for posterity. Duane Johnson was registered in support and available for questions.\nPreservation Planner Heather Bailey acknowledged the building’s connection to The Capitol Times and noted that information is available in the preservation file. She explained that the building has undergone several renovations over the years.\nCommissioner Morrison noted that while the building’s architect, Philip Homer, designed many notable buildings in Madison, this is not among his more significant works. He noted the building was not landmarked and supported recording the site for posterity. Commissioner Harris expressed appreciation for Mr. Rolling’s comments and leaned toward recording the site. Commissioner Arnesen observed that the interior has been extensively modified with no historic features remaining.\nStaff recommended a finding of “B” - the building has historic value to the vernacular context as it housed the Capitol Times from 1928 to 1949.\nAlder Duncan moved for a finding of “B” - that the building itself is not historically, architecturally, or culturally significant. Commissioner Morrison seconded. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nAugust 4, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nIt was a short agenda this evening with the meeting taking less than 25 minutes.\n\nRequest for Certificate of Approval of an addition to this Third Lake Ridge Historic District property located at 739 Jenifer St in District 6 Legistar 88975 was moved to the Consent Agenda. Motion to approve was made by Alderman Duncan and seconded by Jacob Morrison and passed unanimously.\n\n\n\n\nSite plan and elevation drawings for the 739 Jenifer St addition\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitectural renderings showing the proposed addition to 739 Jenifer St\n\n\n\nSauthoff House - 740 Jenifer St\nLegistar 88974 - Request for Certificate of Approval of Demolition and Addition to a Designated Madison Landmark\nThe home is in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District (District 6). The building, known as the Sauthoff House, was built in 1857 and was designated a Madison landmark in 1977. Frederick (a tailor) and Johanna Sauthoff moved from Hanover, Germany and were the first owners of the home. The Sauthoff House was designated a landmark for its association with 19th century merchant families in the early history of the city and for its vernacular architecture. In the 1950s a rear addition was added to the home. This addition, like other additions to historic homes in that period, has no significance in its own right.\n\n\n\nHistoric photograph of the Sauthoff House at 740 Jenifer St, showing the original 1857 structure\n\n\nThe original building is characterized by its blocky style. The proposed addition on the back of the structure (which faces the lake) is a contemporary interpretation of this same blocky style. There will also be large open areas with many of the areas featuring large glass windows.\n\n\n\nArchitectural renderings of the proposed contemporary addition to the rear of the Sauthoff House\n\n\n\n\n\nSite plan and elevation drawings showing the integration of the new addition with the historic structure\n\n\nJoy Newmann, the next-door neighbor, spoke very highly of the owner’s care for the home and the proposed project. Leslie Marshall (homeowner), Michael Abraham and Abigal Rohlinger (Michael Abraham Architecture), and Mikael Eder (Bachman Construction) were available to answer questions. There were no questions.\nStaff believes the standards for granting a Certificate of Approval could be met with several conditions. Jacob Morrison, Katherine Kaliszewski and Molly Harris made positive comments regarding the project and how well the contemporary addition blends with the original historic building.\nMotion made by Molly Harris and seconded by Jacob Morrison to approve the project with recommended conditions. Motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nJuly 21, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nThe meeting was called to order at 5:01 p.m. and lasted 21 minutes and 53 seconds. The June 7th minutes were approved.\n\nMadison Trust for Historic Preservation Grant Program\nLegistar 62943 - Presentation on Grant Opportunities\nJennifer Gurske, President of the Madison Trust for Historic Preservation, presented information about the organization’s new grant program. The program was made possible through a generous donation from Erica Gehrig.\nThe Madison Trust will award a total of $10,000 annually in grants, with individual awards ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.

These projects typically involve significant expenses, and while grants provide assistance, they do not cover the full project cost. - Madison Landmark Nominations: Supporting the designation of historic landmarks within the city.\nAdditional resources are available: - Madison Trust for Historic Preservation information - Tax Credits for Historic Building Rehabilitation - Historic Rehabilitation Loans\n\n\nDemolition Historic Value Review - East Washington Avenue Redevelopment\nSeven buildings were presented for demolition approval as part of a larger redevelopment project. Staff recommended approval for all seven properties, finding they meet the standard of “No Historical Value.” The following properties, all located in District 12, were reviewed:\nLegistar 89126 - 930 N. Fair Oaks Avenue\n\nLegistar 89127 - 3357 E. Washington Avenue\n\nLegistar 89128 - 3359 E. Washington Avenue\n\nLegistar 89133 - 3361 E. Washington Avenue\n\nLegistar 89137 - 3365 E. Washington Avenue\n\nLegistar 89140 - 3371 E. Washington Avenue\n\nLegistar 89143 - 3375 E. Washington Avenue\n\nCommissioner Harris moved to approve Items 3-9 for demolition based on the finding of no historic value. Alder Duncan seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously without discussion. The meeting then adjourned.\n\n\n\nJune 16, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Landmarks Commission meeting was called to order at 5:01 p.m. and lasted 13 minutes. The minutes of June 2nd were approved. There were no disclosures or recusals.\nThe following items were approved on the Consent Agenda: - Request for Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition, new construction, and exterior alteration at 413 S. Brearly Street in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District (District 6) - Legistar 88408 - Request for Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction at 1717 Kendall Avenue in the University Heights Historic District (District 5) - Legistar 88409 - Request for Certificate of Appropriateness for an addition at 2113 Kendall Avenue in the University Heights Historic District (District 5) - Legistar 88410\n\nDemolition and New Construction - 413 S. Brearly Street\nLegistar 88408 - Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition, new construction, and exterior alteration at 413 S. Brearly Street in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District (District 6).\nThe project involves demolishing an existing garage and replacing it with a similar structure. Additionally, repairs will be made to damaged columns and railings on the front porch of the house. The current wood railings are not historic, and the existing garage is a simple, utilitarian structure without historical or architectural significance.\nStaff determined that all standards have been met and recommended approval. Application details with location diagrams and staff report are available online.\n\n\nNew Construction - 1717 Kendall Avenue\nLegistar 88409 - Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction at 1717 Kendall Avenue in the University Heights Historic District (District 5).\nThe project proposes constructing a new garage on this corner property. The historic home is a Queen Anne-style structure with clapboard siding. The new garage design maintains compatibility with the historic district’s character while clearly reading as contemporary and secondary to the historic home.\nStaff determined that all standards have been met and recommended approval. Application with photos and staff report are available online.\n\n\nAddition - 2113 Kendall Avenue\nLegistar 88410 - Certificate of Appropriateness for an addition at 2113 Kendall Avenue in the University Heights Historic District (District 5).\nThe project includes constructing a rear addition to replace a non-historic addition on this 1922 vernacular house, plus adding a new second-story window. The rear addition will feature a slight wall inset to distinguish it from the historic structure, while matching the siding, trim, and window configuration of the original house. However, the proposed second-story window would be highly visible from the public right-of-way and does not meet standards.\nStaff recommended approval with the condition that the applicant submit updated drawings removing the proposed second-story window. Application with diagrams and staff report are available online.\nCommissioner Arnesen moved to accept all consent agenda items, seconded by Commissioner Morrison. The motion passed unanimously.\n\n\nHistoric Preservation Ordinance Amendment\nLegistar 88383 - Amendment to Madison General Ordinances Chapter 41 and associated references in Chapters 1, 28, and 31.\nThis item continued discussions from the April 21, 2025 Special In-Person Meeting regarding updates to historic landmark buildings ordinances. The proposed changes modernize language for clarity and ease of use, including: - Changing “Certificate of Appropriateness” to “Certificate of Approval” - Removing the term “Master” in favor of standardized professional terminology - Revising Computation of Time for Public Notice to 14 days for consistency throughout city ordinances\nCommissioner Taylor inquired about public feedback and the dissemination process for these changes. Preservation Planner Heather Bailey reported no public feedback received and confirmed that approved changes will be published in relevant documents and available online following Common Council approval.\nThe staff report detailing proposed changes is available for review.\nCommissioner Arnesen moved to recommend approval to Common Council, seconded by Commissioner Morrison. The motion passed unanimously. The meeting then adjourned.\n\n\n\nJune 2, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nThe meeting of the Landmarks Commission was called to order at 5:00 p.m. and lasted 1 hour and 6 minutes. The minutes of the May 19th meeting were approved.\nPublic Comments - This item gives members of the public an opportunity to comment on items that are not on the agenda. There were no comments.\nDisclosures and Recusals - There were none.\n\nRequest for Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction on a designated Madison Landmark site located at 1775 Norman Way in District 19 Legistar 88189 was moved to the Consent Agenda. Motion made by Jacob Morrison and seconded by Molly Harris to approve the project.\n\n\nDevelopment Adjacent to Mattermore-Malaney House - 501 E. Washington Ave\nLegistar 88188 - Advisory Recommendation for Development Adjacent to a Designated Madison Landmark\nThe Landmarks Commission is an advisory body to the Urban Design and Planning Commissions in this matter as the project is adjacent to the Mattermore-Malaney House landmark at 512 E. Main St (District 6).\nKurt Stege commented positively about the move of the inlet from E. Washington St. to East Main St., believing it made a big difference in the proposal. He informed the Commission of the relationships between the landmark homes in the area and their significance to each other, and wondered what trees would come down and which could stay.\nMarc Ott, Nick Orthmann and several other members of the design team were available to speak in support of the project and answer questions.\nHeather Bailey, Preservation Planner, provided a summary of the project. The project will redevelop the property at 501 E. Washington to build a 7-story apartment building. This property shares a rear property line with the Mattermore-Malaney House at 512 E. Main St. The Mattermore-Malaney House was designated a Madison landmark in 2002 for its architectural significance as a rare and exceptionally intact example of a frame, Front Gable house. The house, constructed in 1874, is a simple clapboard structure located within the First Settlement local historic district. This area of the neighborhood has a mix of similarly scaled residential structures and larger infill apartment buildings. The landmark home has a deep residential lot (133 feet) with a substantial tree canopy. This tree canopy, along with the inset in the proposed rear wall-plane of the adjacent new structure, creates a visual buffer.\nJacob Morrison and Molly Harris asked the design team if they had considered utilizing setbacks on some of the upper floors of the apartment building to lighten the impact of the height. Marc Ott explained there are some setbacks in certain areas across the upper facade.\nStaff recommends to the Landmarks Commission to advise the Plan and Urban Design Commissions that the proposed work will not be so large or visually intrusive as to adversely affect the historic character and integrity of the adjoining landmark.\nJacob made a motion to advise the Urban Design and Planning Commissions that the proposed work will not be so large or visually intrusive that it would adversely affect the historic character and integrity of the adjoining landmark. Motion passed unanimously.\n\n\nSpring Harbor Mound Group - 1775 Norman Way\nLegistar 88189 - Certificate of Appropriateness for New Construction on a Designated Madison Landmark Site\nThe applicant is requesting that the Landmarks Commission approve a Certificate of Appropriateness to make alterations to a designated landmark site in District 19. The proposed project is to build a detached garage on the residential property that is part of a collection of properties within the boundary of the Spring Harbor Mound Group Landmark site. Staff have worked with the property owner to make sure the new garage is located well away from the burial mounds in the area. The Office of the State Archaeologist has approved a Request to Disturb for this project, in compliance with Wisconsin Burial Law. Staff agree with the State that this project is unlikely to disturb the burial mounds and will not have a negative impact on the historic integrity of the site. Staff believe that the standards for granting a Certificate of Appropriateness are met and recommend the project be approved.\n\n\nNorth-South Bus Rapid Transit - Section 106 Review\nLegistar 88465 - Section 106 Review for Bus Rapid Transit Project\nThe City of Madison is proposing a north-south bus rapid transit (BRT) route affecting Districts 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18. The project is pursuing funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and therefore it must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulations 36 CFR Part 800. Section 106 requires the consideration of effects to historic properties, which are defined as any district, site, building, structure, or object listed in, or determined eligible for listing in, the National Register of Historic Places. As a result, the bus stations are considered structures that require review by the advisory body.\nHeather Bailey gave a brief explanation of the North-South Bus Rapid Transit, explaining that this route and the bus stations are much less concerning from a historical perspective than the East-West route was because the North-South route doesn’t run near Historic Districts.\nMike Cechvala, of the Planning Division, explained the project in more detail. The Rapid Route B is Transit’s 2nd Bus Transit Rapid Route. It will provide 9.1 miles of new BRT runningway and includes 23 new stations. It is the stations that are of concern to Landmarks.\nKatherine Kaliszewski commented that she is one of the Cultural Resource Managers for the Department of Transportation. Although most of her work involves highways, she knows the reviewer for this project and knows she will want to see pictures of the stations with emphasis on detail. She added it is important to be very specific and clear that the stations will be similar but will not all look the same. She noted that the station on Park St. is not labeled as a full reconstruct but it appears it is almost a full reconstruct so it needs to be labeled as such. They also must be clear with the reviewer that potentially minor changes will need to be made along the way.\nStaff determines there are no adverse effects on historical properties by the project.\nAlder Duncan commented that he would like the project to come back to LMC as a review.\nMotion by Molly Harris that Landmarks has no comments at this time and would agree with the determination of no adverse effects on historical properties but would like to remain a consulting party and be notified of any changes that have the potential of impacting historical resources. Motion passed unanimously.\n\n\nKennedy Road Charging Station - Section 106 Review\nLegistar 88466 - Section 106 Review for On-Route Charging Station\nMike Cechvala, of the Planning Division, provided a presentation on the planned on-route charging stations in District 18. These stations will be located at the end of both routes. Currently the bus has to go back to the garage to charge, which is costly and time-consuming.\nInstallation of the on-route chargers on Northport Drive and Kennedy Rd. is a separate project. The project is in the design stage with construction expected in 2025 and 2026 and planned completion in 2026. The charging connection is overhead and includes a support building.\nStaff determines there are no adverse effects on historical properties by the project.\nMotion by Molly Harris and seconded by Edna Ely-Ledesma that Landmarks has no comments at this time and would agree with the determination of no adverse effects on historical properties. Motion passed unanimously.\n\n\nDemolition Historic Value Review - 630 E. Washington Ave\nLegistar 88190 - Consideration of a Demolition Permit to Demolish a Commercial Building\nThis building in District 6 was constructed in 1959 as St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic School and is described as a simple instructional-type building with little architectural interest. The Landmarks Commission completed a historic value review of this same structure on August 26, 2019, and found it to have no known historic value. The Salvation Army of Dane County is proposing a redevelopment of their current property at 630 E. Washington Avenue. Currently the Salvation Army operates a women and family homeless shelter and services at the site in the former catholic school building. The proposed redevelopment would raze the current building and adjacent parking lots to the east and construct a new purpose-built shelter building. The new shelter will contain expanded capacity for single women and families stays. Additionally, it will provide respite recovery rooms, supportive services including case management, food service, classroom training rooms, multi-purpose space, and recreational space. Also, there will be space for medical primary health, mental health, and dental services to be provided.\nStaff recommendation is of no known historic value.\nThe motion made for a finding of no historical value was made by Jacob Morrison, seconded by Edna Ely-Ledesma. Motion passed unanimously.\n\n\n\nMay 5, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nThe Annual Special Meeting of the Landmarks Commission was held in person and lasted 1 hour and 6 minutes.\nMembers present: John Duncan (Common Council Member), Jacob Morrison (Registered Architect), Molly Harris (Historian), Maurice Taylor (Licensed Realtor), Edna Ely-Ledesma (Adult City Resident), Richard Arnesen (Adult City Resident), and Katherine Kaliszewski (Adult City Resident). Heather Bailey, Preservation Planner, served as the staff representative.\n\nCommission Orientation and SOI Standards Review\nLegistar 83865 - Commission Orientation and Parliamentary Procedures\nThe meeting began with a brief history and purpose of the Landmarks Commission, followed by an orientation on parliamentary procedures. The commission then reviewed the Secretary of Interior (SOI) Standards.\nDuring the discussion, a commissioner inquired about potential impacts from the Trump administration’s policies on the Commission’s work. Heather Bailey indicated that several Executive Orders have streamlined federal compliance processes, potentially removing stakeholder involvement from groups like the Commission and State Historical Preservation offices. She noted that if federal standards are eliminated, they may still be applicable if local ordinance language is modified.\nBailey also informed the Commission that staff received notification to halt work on a previously awarded Certifiable Local Government grant. The grant was intended to develop a historic context for public, civic, and commercial architecture from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Since federal funds had not yet been encumbered, the project cannot proceed.\n\n\nFive-Year Review of Historic Preservation Plan\nLegistar 83866 - Five-Year Check-in on Madison Historic Preservation Plan\nThe Commission reviewed progress on the Madison Historic Preservation Plan, adopted in 2020. The plan is updated every 10 years to ensure the preservation program remains focused and represents Madison’s diverse history.\nPriority strategies discussed include, but are not limited to: - Placing plaques at existing buildings and places - Developing tourism marketing and branding materials highlighting historic attractions - Coordinating an urban design program to promote city-owned historic buildings and places - Identifying underrepresented building types in the historic resources inventory - Developing a “top 10” list of historic buildings and places to preserve - Encouraging adaptive reuse for affordable housing options\nThe full plan is available online. All projects remain ongoing.\n\n\nHistoric Preservation Ordinance Text Amendment\nLegistar 88167 - Proposed Historic Preservation Ordinance Text Amendment\nHeather Bailey guided commissioners through proposed updates to the Historic Preservation Ordinance. Key changes include clarifying ambiguous language and updating terminology to coordinate with current building permit terminology. A red-lined copy was provided to commissioners and is available online for public review.\nThis matter will proceed to the Common Council for approval. Discussion was minimal.\n\n\n\nMarch 10, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nThe commission members met virtually at 5pm with all present except Katie Kal, who arrived at 5:20 pm.  Richard Arnesen chaired the meeting until Kal’s arrival. Only one item was moved to the consent agenda, which passed unanimously:\n\nRequest for Certificate of Appropriateness regarding exterior alteration of signage in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District for a property located at 315 S. Blount St in District 6 Legistar 87365.\n\n\nBenjamin and Amy Butts House\nThe first item of the night was approving a landmark nomination for the Benjamin and Amy Butts house, located at 633 East Johnson Street in District 6 Legistar 87159. Staff recommends this property for nomination indicating it meets Criteria A & B. \nRegarding criteria A, the House is associated with the broad patterns of cultural, political, economic, or social history of the nation, state or community. The nomination makes a well-documented case for this property’s association with the early era of Madison’s African-American community. Madison’s Underrepresented Communities Historic Resources Survey identifies this period as spanning from Madison’s first recorded African- American resident in 1839 until the early 20th Century.  The activism and community - building undertaken by the Butts family while they lived at this home had a significant effect on their community as Madison grew.  \nWith regard to criteria B, Staff indicate it is associated with the lives of important person, and/or with important events in national, state, or local history. The nomination primarily document’s the story of Benjamin Butts, but also includes details of the community activism of Amy Butts.  Both were leaders in Madison, serving as founders for key African-American cultural institutions, such as the St. Paul’s AME Church and the Capital City Lodge #2 of the Prince Hall Masons.  While Amy and Benjamin lived at this home, they took in African-American borders as people moved to Madison to live and work.  They also partnered with other leaders to establish Madison’s first African-American neighborhood located at the  600 block of E. Dayton St. \nWhile reviewing the substance of the nomination in order to advise the Common Council, the Commission heard from several members of the public. Bob Klebba spoke in support of the nomination. Klebba was also the person who initiated the nomination process. He notes the building came to his attention when a preservation planner suggested this building was worthy of a Landmark Nomination.  The building is not attractive, doesn’t have notable architectural features and the inside has been remodeled. It also leans noticeably to the west. What makes this site important is who lived there.   Klebba goes on to say how landmarking this building was made easier than some sites because the history of the people who lived there was already documented. This made it cheaper for the Madison Trust to contract out the work as a lot of the background information was already documented.  Klebba continued, stating how as a voluntary organization it is difficult and too expensive for the Madison Trust to do more than one nomination a year. Klebba “would ask the Commission to keep this in mind when the Madison Trust and other historical preservationists are perceived as acting at the last minute when demolition applications come to the Landmark Commission and on to the Plan Commission.”  Klebba also states a typical nomination cost the Madison Trust between $3,500 and $7,500 to complete.  \nJoe Lusson and Commissioner Taylor spoke in support as well and stated the owners of the building also support the nomination. Commissioner Taylor added this house is likely to come before the Landmarks Commission again, as it may need some rehab in the future—urging some leeway on these potential rehab needs. \nWhile Elizabeth Miller was present for questions, there were none and the public hearing was closed. \nMotion recommend to Councial approval of the landmark nomination made by Maurice Taylor, which was seconded by Jacob Morrison before being passed unanimously.\n\n\nSt. Bernard’s Catholic Church\nThe next item up for discussion was the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for an addition to St. Bernard’s Catholic Church, a designated Madison landmark located at 2450 Atwood Avenue in District 15. Specifically,the request is to build onto the existing structure in order to construct a crypt.\nThe location of this addition would be in the courtyard between the church structure and the rectory.  The crypt is proposed as a single-story gabled structure with windows, attached to the church but separated from the historic structure by a smaller addition. The addition will stay with the architectural character of the historic building.  The project also includes replacing an ornamental concrete block privacy wall with a decorative metal fence. Detailed specifications for the fencing and windows for the crypt have not been provided at this time.  \nBradley Servin was available for questions and stated the roof for the crypt will have the same copper roofing of the original church and the same stone veneer.  \nStaff believe the standards are met for granting the Certificate of Appropriateness and recommended the Landmarks Commission approve the project with conditions which relate to the specification for the new fencing and window details for the crypt to be approved by staff when available. The item passed unanimously, with conditions on the fencing and windows as stated.  \n\n\nMansion Hill Historic District\nThe commission shifted their focus to the combination of land and new construction at 124 East Gorham Street in the Mansion Hill Historic District, which resides in District 2 Legistar 87103.\nJoel Koeppen, design leader of Kahler Slater INC,  submitted materials and presented the plans. This included:\n\nExisting Structures: The existing Carriage House is a historic resource and is intended to remain on site. The structure is to remain generally intact but reprogramed on the interior. \nProposed Lot Combination: The plan is to combine 124 E. Gorham St. with 116 E. Gorham, of which there is historical precedent. H. Bailey, City Preservation Planner, provided documentation to support this action.\nProposed Development: The proposed development consists of a 5 story, 22-unit Multifamily Residential building with subgrade parking.  The existing Carriage House is to be renovated and reprogrammed as a community space and additional units.\n\nThe project type is new construction of residential apartments in the Mansion Hill District.  Staff have been working with the property owner on possible options for infill new construction on the property at 124 E. Gorham. This property is currently a gravel parking lot with an 1860’s carriage house on the rear of the site.  While the lot was once part of the adjacent landmarked Brown House property (112 E. Gorham) by the mid - 20th century, it operated as a separate parcel. The project is exploring two options: (1) keeping the lot separate or (2) combining the lot with the adjacent Brown House lot.\nKeeping the lot separate with a new residential structure at the front, which would have to comply with Historic District Standards and have review for Development Adjacent to a Landmark. Alternatively, combining with the Brown House lot would require a Certificate of Appropriateness for land combination and the new construction at the front of 124 East Gorham would need to comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard for Rehabilitation. \nThe informational presentation explored the feasibility of the second option. Staff have concerns about the massing, contextual setback, and architectural character of the proposed new construction. Connecting the new structure to the carriage house will also raise problems with Zoning standards. The historic carriage house needs space so that it is not obscured. If the property is a part of the landmark site, then the new construction will need to look like it belongs to that site, but with significant separation from the historic resources so that the new construction does not overwhelm them.     Commissioner Morrison commented the lot sizes need to be considered and look at comparable structures in the area.  The carriage house connector can be tricky and recommend making the connector look like it could be removed. The lowering of the roof line to 4 stories helps a lot.  Proportion of window space to wall space seems off and makes the windows look small. Similarly, Commissioner Kal stated the porches look too modern and suggests making the front of the building more pronounced and less like a driveway.\nBob Klebba spoke in opposition. Klebba also owns the Governor’s Mansion Inn, a boutique hotel located at 130 East Gillman St. Klebba explained the current Brown House and carriage house resembles the original look of the area with the buildings on the large lots, using historical maps to give the Commision a visual representation. Klebba further complained how neighboring lots have been filled in with 1950’s apartment buildings as well as the 1970’s Verex Plaza building, which provide no context to the National Landmark buildings.\nBruce Bosben of Apex Properties spoke in support his company, as Apex Properties owns the Brown House in addition to the Carriage House and 124 Giillman to the north. Bosben overall owns five buildings listed on the National Registry—which he claims is more historic buildings in Madison than anyone else. He has owned the Carriage House for at least 20 years and would like to build on this lot. \nCommissioner Arnesen stated their belief that the proposed building is too large for the site and crowds out the carriage house. They further voiced concern about brick size for the project, which proposes using a modular size brick rather than a utility size brick. Alternatively, Commissioner Taylor stated he likes the way the building looks and argued the owner is making an effort. \nAlder Latimer Burris mentioned wanting to take a look at the property, stating the proposal is a lot to digest expressing the desire for more time to get additional feedback. She asked whether the Madison Trust has weighed in at all, to which Heather Bailey responded the Madison Trust has not weighed in, but the Commission will hear from them when an actual application is completed. \nCommissioner Harris spoke on how the Carriage House is not designated a Historical site, only the Brown house—drawing attention to how the primary consideration at hand is the new construction.\nKoeppen thanked the Commission for their input and comments before stating they will continue to work towards a design that will meet the needs of the city while maintaining the integrity of the historical significance of the area. \n\n\n2604 Waunona Way\nProposed demolition of buildings located at 2604 Waunona Way in Distract 14 was also on the evening’s agenda Legistar 86033. Having been built between 1901 and 1902, Staff recommended a finding of historical value related to vernacular architecture; however, the building itself is not historically significant. This property is also located within the boundary of the Waunona Mounds site and any ground-disturbing activity would need to secure a Request to Disturb from the Wisconsin State Archaeologist and notify the Ho-Chunk National Tribal Historic Preservation Office.\nThe commission determined there is no historical value to the home, but acknowledged the Waunona Mounds site and the need to secure a Request to Disturb. A motion was made to approve and unanimously passed.\n\n\nShort Items\nWith the meeting nearing a close, the Commission quickly reviewed historical value for 6105 South Highland Avenue and 2326 Vondron Drive.\nAlthough 6105 South Highland Avenue is a single family home built in 1875, Staff recommended no historic value. Similarly, 2326 Vondron Road was not recommended to have historic value as it was built in 2000. Notably, 2326 Vondron suffered a fire, which has lead the Madison Fire Department to submit a request to demolish the commercial building.\nThe Commission agree with Staff, and a motion finding no historic value was unanimously passed.\n\n\nSecretary’s Report Highlights\nThe Secretary’s Report then reminded the Commission the new demolition process went into effect March 9, 2025, but the Landmarks Commission will still see all demolition applications.\n\n\n\nFebruary 10, 2025\nBy Diane Zenz\nOfficial Minutes\nOn Monday night, the City of Madison’s Landmarks Commission met to discuss several proposals and items: a proposed amendment to the Lamp House Report, a development adjacent to an established historical building, and additions to historic districts. Among the consent agenda:\n\nLegistar 86590: Land Combination/Division at 1937 Arlington Place and 2013-2021 Chamberlain Ave in the University Heights Historic District located in District 5\nLegistar 86668: An addition to a Designated Madison Landmark, namely St. Bernard’s Catholic Church, located at 2450 Atwood Ave in District 15 \n\n\nAmending the 2013 Report of the Lamp House Block Ad Hoc Plan Committee Legistar 86824.\nThe Lamp House is a Frank Lloyd Wright building situated two blocks northeast of the Capitol.  It was built in 1903 and is the oldest Wright building in Madison.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  The mid-block location (unique among Wright’s works) is bound by East Washington, Mifflin, Webster, and Butler Streets.  It is only accessible from Butler Street via a narrow, ascending driveway on a right of way between two homes. The keyhole lot then opens up, producing a compression/ release dynamic encountered frequently in Wright’s works. Although completely landlocked, the home originally provided viewscapes comparable to lakefront residential buildings. It has always been surrounded on all four sides by residential buildings and although the southern viewshed towards Lake Monona has been cut off by a high-rise on the adjacent lot and the westward view toward the Capitol was blocked by new construction in 2015, the penthouse enclosure (added on the roof) still has a view of Lake Mendota to the North and west.  This three story building has exposed basement windows and a rooftop garden.\nAld. Bennett made a request to Council to amend the Report of the Lamp House Block Ad Hoc Plan Committee to remove or change some of the recommendations to restrict building heights around the Lamp House. Although Common Council later decided not to restrict building heights in existing plans, the recommendations in the Lamp House report have a status similar to city plans and so may restrict development. Landmark’s role is advisory only and the issues at hand consist of viewing to and from the Lamp House and Reference to Building Height. \nThe first proposed change to the initial report of 2013 focuses on which views should be prioritized for preservation (Page 3 of staff report). The report assesses View 1 (North Butler Street) should be preserved, whereas Views 2 and 3 (East Mifflin Street) should be preserved if feasible. The feasibility of preserving Views 2 and 3 should be determined by the Plan Commission during the review of a development proposal, subject to Common Council approval in the case of a planned development. View 4 has been partially accommodated in a redevelopment project undertaken after the adoption of this report. \nThe second proposed change (page 4 of staff report) focuses on the maximum building heights in the downtown plan as adopted in 2012 and subsequently incorporated into the zoning code. In summary, this would eliminate Lamp House viewscape restrictions in the area that effectively restrict buildings to 3 stories. \nAlder Bennet (who made the requested change) spoke in support of preserving the Lamp House viewscapes, but stated if the requested changes are not made, 452 properties in her district can not be developed above three stories. Alder Bennet also stated she loves the Lamp House and the views are amazing, but we should be able to build houses and preserve history at the same time.  She additionally indicated she has developers contacting her all the time. \nNan Fay - who spoke in opposition- believes there is no need to make changes to the current plan. Alternatively, Bruce Bosban (of Apex Property Management - developer and landlord in Madison) spoke in support of the  changes. He stated he is one of the largest providers of natural affordable housing in Madison, owning 2,000 units in the city with the majority renting to low income families. Bosben informed the committee he has been buying old buildings to restore and renovate for over 40 years, owning five buildings on the National Register of Historic Places including the Lamp House. Last year, Bosben spent over $12 million  restoring buildings that are over 100 years old and has also been involved in new development—having completed five developments in the last five years. Bosdan would like to build smaller efficiency units that will be priced as low income, as well as market priced buildings. The Lamp House complained that he “can’t get a plan past Staff in Planning” due to the low building height requirements and argued lower story buildings are not financially possible.  There was a bit of a back and forth between Bosban and the chair of the Landmark Commission in regard to his statement that he doesn’t take TIF money or historic tax credits to build. The chair asked “is that because you don’t want to have to follow the standards?” In a  sarcastic tone, the chair asked if he needed help getting that information.  Finally,  Alder Bennet asked if this questioning of Historic Tax Credits was relevant to the question at hand.  The chair continued to explain her rationale for the questions until Staff Heather Bailey broke in to say that the line of questioning was out of order.\nCommissioner Maurice Taylor asked Bosdan how many buildings he was planning to raze. Bosban replied with his goal of four buildings that face Mifflin Street and one that faces Butler Street, with about 50 units each. At this point the chair reminded the commission it was not their role to ask about future projects.\nKurt Stegge spoke in opposition, stating that the proposal is rewriting history. No one should add to a report done over a decade ago. Linda Lenards further voiced opposition, claiming the changes will impinge on views and if this change is made there will only be one view down a 12 foot wide alley.  Alex Saloutos then urged the committee to not make the proposed changes, stating the Staff report does not address compliance of the proposed changes with the city’s historic preservation plan and their impact on this site. Saloutos further claimed the change fails to analyze the impact of the proposed changes of the Lamp House site.\nTheir statements were echeod by Robert Klebba, a well known preservationist with the Madison Historical Trust. Klebba urged Landmarks to not approve the amendment because the Lamp House is the only urban Frank Lloyd Wright site and mentioned there is already a plan for this block. Klebba boasted that it is an exceptional property.  The argument to make this block conform to city wide zoning so that Planning’s job is easier flies in the face of having a special plan for this block and for this landmark. Klebba argued conformity is not more important than preservation. Alder Bennet then mentioned working with the Lamp House’s property owner to develop natural occurring affordable housing in order to build market rate housing at significantly higher rental cost, which will decrease affordable housing options. \nAfter much discussion a motion was made to return the request to LEAD with the Recommendation to Place on File without Prejudice to the Plan Commission. The motion passed unanimously. \n\n\nRepealing and recreating Section 28.185 and creating Section 41.28 of the Madison General Ordinances related to demolition of buildings to update the approval process Legistar 86649.\nThe Landmarks Commission currently sees all requests for demolition to determine historical value then the application goes to the Planning Commission where a Public Hearing is held before being either approved or denied.  \nUnder the proposed process, all applications will still go to the Landmarks Commission first. If the building is determined to have “Historical Value” or is a “Regrettable Loss” it will continue in the normal fashion on to the Plan Commission; however, if a determination is made that the building has no historical value, the application will bypass the Plan Commission and the Public Hearing—going directly to city staff, where the approval will be issued administratively. \nIn the proposed change, it is required that all materials provided to the Landmark Commission be provided to the Planning Commission.  \nProposed (MGO 28.185)\nTwo Standards must be met: Demolition aid plan implementation or purpose statement. According to the proposal, “what outweighs preservation may include, but not be limited to, conditions (including  city reports on the same), loss of historical features, plans for mitigating the impact of the lost building.” The Statement of Purpose was an area that the Landmarks Commission had a lot of conversations and concerns with.\nBased on the data provided:\n\n74% of buildings approved for demolition have No Known Historical Value.\n18% of buildings approved for demolition have a determination of Regrettable Loss.\n9% of buildings approved for demolition have a determination of Historical Value.\n\nEleven people from the community spoke against the proposed change. They expressed concerns over the possibility of lost property to demolitions and that this will have a sweeping impact on preservation. There was a discussion about adding language regarding the importance of archaeological value.\nA motion was made to recommend approval of the revised language in the historic preservation ordinance with the addition of language regarding archaeology under historic value Criterion C (No Historic Value). The landmarks Commission requested that Common Council re-refer the item to the Landmarks Commission in order to have sufficient time to review the zoning section of the ordinance. The motion passed unanimously. \n\n\n1 South Ingersol Street\nThe Plan Commission continued their meeting, moving their focus to development adjacent to a designated Madison landmark at the Gisholt Machine Co. Manufacturing Complex at 1301 East Washington Avenue Legistar 86671. The historic property in question: 1 South Ingersoll St. in District 6. Proposed work is fairly extensive, including: \n\nConstruct new rear addition\nReplace non historic windows\nMasonry Repair\nSite work\nThe site is connected to the Madison Metro Bus Barn\nThere will be a facade change\nRehab it back to its former historic look\nAdd a bright colored mural\nSawtooth area on roof (will not be seen)\n\nA motion was made and the request was approved unanimously.\n\n\nMackenzie House\nThe committee reviewed the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Mackenzie House, located at 2525 Marshall Parkway in District 13 Legistar 86953. Not only does the home have distinctive architecture, but there is also an archaeological site on the property.\nThe nomination was supported by the Landmarks Commission, who will submit comments as the certified local government to the State Preservation Review Board and National Park Service.  A motion made and the passed unanimously.\n\n\nUniversity Heights Historic District\nThe commission also discussed an addition proposal in the University Heights Historic District, specifically 2006 Van Hise Avenue in District 5 Legistar 86669. After reviewing the Certificate of Appropriateness for the Mediterranean revival style home, which was constructed in 1924, the Commission went over the proposed work. This includes the construction of a new rear addition, replacement of non-historic windows, masonry repair, and miscellaneous site work. Ultimately, the Commission approved the proposal."
